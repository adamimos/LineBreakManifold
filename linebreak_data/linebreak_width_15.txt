Mr. Bennet was
among the
earliest of
those who
waited on Mr.
Bingley. He had
always intended
to visit him,
though to the
last always
assuring his
wife that he
should not go;
and till the
evening after
the visit was
paid she had no
knowledge of
it. It was then
disclosed in
the following
manner.
Observing his
second daughter
employed in
trimming a hat,
he suddenly
addressed her
with,-- “I hope
Mr. Bingley
will like it,
Lizzy.” “We are
not in a way to
know _what_ Mr.
Bingley likes,”
said her
mother,
resentfully,
“since we are
not to visit.”
“But you
forget, mamma,”
said Elizabeth,
“that we shall
meet him at the
assemblies, and
that Mrs. Long
has promised to
introduce him.”
“I do not
believe Mrs.
Long will do
any such thing.
She has two
nieces of her
own. She is a
selfish,
hypocritical
woman, and I
have no opinion
of her.” “No
more have I,”
said Mr.
Bennet; “and I
am glad to find
that you do not
depend on her
serving you.”
Mrs. Bennet
deigned not to
make any reply;
but, unable to
contain
herself, began
scolding one of
her daughters.
“Don’t keep
coughing so,
Kitty, for
heaven’s sake!
Have a little
compassion on
my nerves. You
tear them to
pieces.” “Kitty
has no
discretion in
her coughs,”
said her
father; “she
times them
ill.” “I do not
cough for my
own amusement,”
replied Kitty,
fretfully.
“When is your
next ball to
be, Lizzy?”
“To-morrow
fortnight.”
“Ay, so it is,”
cried her
mother, “and
Mrs. Long does
not come back
till the day
before; so, it
will be
impossible for
her to
introduce him,
for she will
not know him
herself.”
“Then, my dear,
you may have
the advantage
of your friend,
and introduce
Mr. Bingley to
_her_.”
“Impossible,
Mr. Bennet,
impossible,
when I am not
acquainted with
him myself; how
can you be so
teasing?” “I
honour your
circumspection.
A fortnight’s
acquaintance is
certainly very
little. One
cannot know
what a man
really is by
the end of a
fortnight. But
if _we_ do not
venture,
somebody else
will; and after
all, Mrs. Long
and her nieces
must stand
their chance;
and, therefore,
as she will
think it an act
of kindness, if
you decline the
office, I will
take it on
myself.” The
girls stared at
their father.
Mrs. Bennet
said only,
“Nonsense,
nonsense!”
“What can be
the meaning of
that emphatic
exclamation?”
cried he. “Do
you consider
the forms of
introduction,
and the stress
that is laid on
them, as
nonsense? I
cannot quite
agree with you
_there_. What
say you, Mary?
For you are a
young lady of
deep
reflection, I
know, and read
great books,
and make
extracts.” Mary
wished to say
something very
sensible, but
knew not how.
“While Mary is
adjusting her
ideas,” he
continued, “let
us return to
Mr. Bingley.”
“I am sick of
Mr. Bingley,”
cried his wife.
“I am sorry to
hear _that_;
but why did you
not tell me so
before? If I
had known as
much this
morning, I
certainly would
not have called
on him. It is
very unlucky;
but as I have
actually paid
the visit, we
cannot escape
the
acquaintance
now.” The
astonishment of
the ladies was
just what he
wished--that of
Mrs. Bennet
perhaps
surpassing the
rest; though
when the first
tumult of joy
was over, she
began to
declare that it
was what she
had expected
all the while.
“How good it
was in you, my
dear Mr.
Bennet! But I
knew I should
persuade you at
last. I was
sure you loved
your girls too
well to neglect
such an
acquaintance.
Well, how
pleased I am!
And it is such
a good joke,
too, that you
should have
gone this
morning, and
never said a
word about it
till now.”
“Now, Kitty,
you may cough
as much as you
choose,” said
Mr. Bennet;
and, as he
spoke, he left
the room,
fatigued with
the raptures of
his wife. “What
an excellent
father you
have, girls,”
said she, when
the door was
shut. “I do not
know how you
will ever make
him amends for
his kindness;
or me either,
for that
matter. At our
time of life,
it is not so
pleasant, I can
tell you, to be
making new
acquaintances
every day; but
for your sakes
we would do
anything.
Lydia, my love,
though you
_are_ the
youngest, I
dare say Mr.
Bingley will
dance with you
at the next
ball.” “Oh,”
said Lydia,
stoutly, “I am
not afraid; for
though I _am_
the youngest,
I’m the
tallest.” The
rest of the
evening was
spent in
conjecturing
how soon he
would return
Mr. Bennet’s
visit, and
determining
when they
should ask him
to dinner.

=====

When Jane and
Elizabeth were
alone, the
former, who had
been cautious
in her praise
of Mr. Bingley
before,
expressed to
her sister how
very much she
admired him.
“He is just
what a
young-man ought
to be,” said
she, “sensible,
good-humoured,
lively; and I
never saw such
happy manners!
so much ease,
with such
perfect good
breeding!” “He
is also
handsome,”
replied
Elizabeth,
“which a young
man ought
likewise to be
if he possibly
can. His
character is
thereby
complete.” “I
was very much
flattered by
his asking me
to dance a
second time. I
did not expect
such a
compliment.”
“Did not you?
_I_ did for
you. But that
is one great
difference
between us.
Compliments
always take
_you_ by
surprise, and
_me_ never.
What could be
more natural
than his asking
you again? He
could not help
seeing that you
were about five
times as pretty
as every other
woman in the
room. No thanks
to his
gallantry for
that. Well, he
certainly is
very agreeable,
and I give you
leave to like
him. You have
liked many a
stupider
person.” “Dear
Lizzy!” “Oh,
you are a great
deal too apt,
you know, to
like people in
general. You
never see a
fault in
anybody. All
the world are
good and
agreeable in
your eyes. I
never heard you
speak ill of a
human being in
my life.” “I
would wish not
to be hasty in
censuring
anyone; but I
always speak
what I think.”
“I know you do:
and it is
_that_ which
makes the
wonder. With
_your_ good
sense, to be so
honestly blind
to the follies
and nonsense of
others!
Affectation of
candour is
common enough;
one meets with
it everywhere.
But to be
candid without
ostentation or
design,--to
take the good
of everybody’s
character and
make it still
better, and say
nothing of the
bad,--belongs
to you alone.
And so, you
like this man’s
sisters, too,
do you? Their
manners are not
equal to his.”
“Certainly not,
at first; but
they are very
pleasing women
when you
converse with
them. Miss
Bingley is to
live with her
brother, and
keep his house;
and I am much
mistaken if we
shall not find
a very charming
neighbour in
her.” Elizabeth
listened in
silence, but
was not
convinced:
their behaviour
at the assembly
had not been
calculated to
please in
general; and
with more
quickness of
observation and
less pliancy of
temper than her
sister, and
with a
judgment, too,
unassailed by
any attention
to herself, she
was very little
disposed to
approve them.
They were, in
fact, very fine
ladies; not
deficient in
good-humour
when they were
pleased, nor in
the power of
being agreeable
where they
chose it; but
proud and
conceited. They
were rather
handsome; had
been educated
in one of the
first private
seminaries in
town; had a
fortune of
twenty thousand
pounds; were in
the habit of
spending more
than they
ought, and of
associating
with people of
rank; and were,
therefore, in
every respect
entitled to
think well of
themselves and
meanly of
others. They
were of a
respectable
family in the
north of
England; a
circumstance
more deeply
impressed on
their memories
than that their
brother’s
fortune and
their own had
been acquired
by trade. Mr.
Bingley
inherited
property to the
amount of
nearly a
hundred
thousand pounds
from his
father, who had
intended to
purchase an
estate, but did
not live to do
it. Mr. Bingley
intended it
likewise, and
sometimes made
choice of his
county; but, as
he was now
provided with a
good house and
the liberty of
a manor, it was
doubtful to
many of those
who best knew
the easiness of
his temper,
whether he
might not spend
the remainder
of his days at
Netherfield,
and leave the
next generation
to purchase.
His sisters
were very
anxious for his
having an
estate of his
own; but though
he was now
established
only as a
tenant, Miss
Bingley was by
no means
unwilling to
preside at his
table; nor was
Mrs. Hurst, who
had married a
man of more
fashion than
fortune, less
disposed to
consider his
house as her
home when it
suited her. Mr.
Bingley had not
been of age two
years when he
was tempted, by
an accidental
recommendation,
to look at
Netherfield
House. He did
look at it, and
into it, for
half an hour;
was pleased
with the
situation and
the principal
rooms,
satisfied with
what the owner
said in its
praise, and
took it
immediately.
Between him and
Darcy there was
a very steady
friendship, in
spite of a
great
opposition of
character.
Bingley was
endeared to
Darcy by the
easiness,
openness, and
ductility of
his temper,
though no
disposition
could offer a
greater
contrast to his
own, and though
with his own he
never appeared
dissatisfied.
On the strength
of Darcy’s
regard, Bingley
had the firmest
reliance, and
of his judgment
the highest
opinion. In
understanding,
Darcy was the
superior.
Bingley was by
no means
deficient; but
Darcy was
clever. He was
at the same
time haughty,
reserved, and
fastidious; and
his manners,
though well
bred, were not
inviting. In
that respect
his friend had
greatly the
advantage.
Bingley was
sure of being
liked wherever
he appeared;
Darcy was
continually
giving offence.
The manner in
which they
spoke of the
Meryton
assembly was
sufficiently
characteristic.
Bingley had
never met with
pleasanter
people or
prettier girls
in his life;
everybody had
been most kind
and attentive
to him; there
had been no
formality, no
stiffness; he
had soon felt
acquainted with
all the room;
and as to Miss
Bennet, he
could not
conceive an
angel more
beautiful.
Darcy, on the
contrary, had
seen a
collection of
people in whom
there was
little beauty
and no fashion,
for none of
whom he had
felt the
smallest
interest, and
from none
received either
attention or
pleasure. Miss
Bennet he
acknowledged to
be pretty; but
she smiled too
much. Mrs.
Hurst and her
sister allowed
it to be so;
but still they
admired her and
liked her, and
pronounced her
to be a sweet
girl, and one
whom they
should not
object to know
more of. Miss
Bennet was
therefore
established as
a sweet girl;
and their
brother felt
authorized by
such
commendation to
think of her as
he chose.

=====

Mr. Bennet’s
property
consisted
almost entirely
in an estate of
two thousand a
year, which,
unfortunately
for his
daughters, was
entailed, in
default of
heirs male, on
a distant
relation; and
their mother’s
fortune, though
ample for her
situation in
life, could but
ill supply the
deficiency of
his. Her father
had been an
attorney in
Meryton, and
had left her
four thousand
pounds. She had
a sister
married to a
Mr. Philips,
who had been a
clerk to their
father and
succeeded him
in the
business, and a
brother settled
in London in a
respectable
line of trade.
The village of
Longbourn was
only one mile
from Meryton; a
most convenient
distance for
the young
ladies, who
were usually
tempted thither
three or four
times a week,
to pay their
duty to their
aunt, and to a
milliner’s shop
just over the
way. The two
youngest of the
family,
Catherine and
Lydia, were
particularly
frequent in
these
attentions:
their minds
were more
vacant than
their sisters’,
and when
nothing better
offered, a walk
to Meryton was
necessary to
amuse their
morning hours
and furnish
conversation
for the
evening; and,
however bare of
news the
country in
general might
be, they always
contrived to
learn some from
their aunt. At
present,
indeed, they
were well
supplied both
with news and
happiness by
the recent
arrival of a
militia
regiment in the
neighbourhood;
it was to
remain the
whole winter,
and Meryton was
the
head-quarters.
Their visits to
Mrs. Philips
were now
productive of
the most
interesting
intelligence.
Every day added
something to
their knowledge
of the
officers’ names
and
connections.
Their lodgings
were not long a
secret, and at
length they
began to know
the officers
themselves. Mr.
Philips visited
them all, and
this opened to
his nieces a
source of
felicity
unknown before.
They could talk
of nothing but
officers; and
Mr. Bingley’s
large fortune,
the mention of
which gave
animation to
their mother,
was worthless
in their eyes
when opposed to
the regimentals
of an ensign.
After listening
one morning to
their effusions
on this
subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly
observed,--
“From all that
I can collect
by your manner
of talking, you
must be two of
the silliest
girls in the
country. I have
suspected it
some time, but
I am now
convinced.”
Catherine was
disconcerted,
and made no
answer; but
Lydia, with
perfect
indifference,
continued to
express her
admiration of
Captain Carter,
and her hope of
seeing him in
the course of
the day, as he
was going the
next morning to
London. “I am
astonished, my
dear,” said
Mrs. Bennet,
“that you
should be so
ready to think
your own
children silly.
If I wished to
think
slightingly of
anybody’s
children, it
should not be
of my own,
however.” “If
my children are
silly, I must
hope to be
always sensible
of it.” “Yes;
but as it
happens, they
are all of them
very clever.”
“This is the
only point, I
flatter myself,
on which we do
not agree. I
had hoped that
our sentiments
coincided in
every
particular, but
I must so far
differ from you
as to think our
two youngest
daughters
uncommonly
foolish.” “My
dear Mr.
Bennet, you
must not expect
such girls to
have the sense
of their father
and mother.
When they get
to our age, I
dare say they
will not think
about officers
any more than
we do. I
remember the
time when I
liked a red
coat myself
very well--and,
indeed, so I do
still at my
heart; and if a
smart young
colonel, with
five or six
thousand a
year, should
want one of my
girls, I shall
not say nay to
him; and I
thought Colonel
Forster looked
very becoming
the other night
at Sir
William’s in
his
regimentals.”
“Mamma,” cried
Lydia, “my aunt
says that
Colonel Forster
and Captain
Carter do not
go so often to
Miss Watson’s
as they did
when they first
came; she sees
them now very
often standing
in Clarke’s
library.” Mrs.
Bennet was
prevented
replying by the
entrance of the
footman with a
note for Miss
Bennet; it came
from
Netherfield,
and the servant
waited for an
answer. Mrs.
Bennet’s eyes
sparkled with
pleasure, and
she was eagerly
calling out,
while her
daughter
read,-- “Well,
Jane, who is it
from? What is
it about? What
does he say?
Well, Jane,
make haste and
tell us; make
haste, my
love.” “It is
from Miss
Bingley,” said
Jane, and then
read it aloud.
/* NIND “My
dear friend, */
“If you are not
so
compassionate
as to dine
to-day with
Louisa and me,
we shall be in
danger of
hating each
other for the
rest of our
lives; for a
whole day’s
_tête-à-tête_
between two
women can never
end without a
quarrel. Come
as soon as you
can on the
receipt of
this. My
brother and the
gentlemen are
to dine with
the officers.
Yours ever,
“CAROLINE
BINGLEY.” “With
the officers!”
cried Lydia: “I
wonder my aunt
did not tell us
of _that_.”
“Dining out,”
said Mrs.
Bennet; “that
is very
unlucky.” “Can
I have the
carriage?” said
Jane. “No, my
dear, you had
better go on
horseback,
because it
seems likely to
rain; and then
you must stay
all night.”
“That would be
a good scheme,”
said Elizabeth,
“if you were
sure that they
would not offer
to send her
home.” “Oh, but
the gentlemen
will have Mr.
Bingley’s
chaise to go to
Meryton; and
the Hursts have
no horses to
theirs.” “I had
much rather go
in the coach.”
“But, my dear,
your father
cannot spare
the horses, I
am sure. They
are wanted in
the farm, Mr.
Bennet, are not
they?”

=====

In consequence
of an agreement
between the
sisters,
Elizabeth wrote
the next
morning to her
mother, to beg
that the
carriage might
be sent for
them in the
course of the
day. But Mrs.
Bennet, who had
calculated on
her daughters
remaining at
Netherfield
till the
following
Tuesday, which
would exactly
finish Jane’s
week, could not
bring herself
to receive them
with pleasure
before. Her
answer,
therefore, was
not propitious,
at least not to
Elizabeth’s
wishes, for she
was impatient
to get home.
Mrs. Bennet
sent them word
that they could
not possibly
have the
carriage before
Tuesday; and in
her postscript
it was added,
that if Mr.
Bingley and his
sister pressed
them to stay
longer, she
could spare
them very well.
Against staying
longer,
however,
Elizabeth was
positively
resolved--nor
did she much
expect it would
be asked; and
fearful, on the
contrary, of
being
considered as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long, she urged
Jane to borrow
Mr. Bingley’s
carriage
immediately,
and at length
it was settled
that their
original design
of leaving
Netherfield
that morning
should be
mentioned, and
the request
made. The
communication
excited many
professions of
concern; and
enough was said
of wishing them
to stay at
least till the
following day
to work on
Jane; and till
the morrow
their going was
deferred. Miss
Bingley was
then sorry that
she had
proposed the
delay; for her
jealousy and
dislike of one
sister much
exceeded her
affection for
the other. The
master of the
house heard
with real
sorrow that
they were to go
so soon, and
repeatedly
tried to
persuade Miss
Bennet that it
would not be
safe for
her--that she
was not enough
recovered; but
Jane was firm
where she felt
herself to be
right. To Mr.
Darcy it was
welcome
intelligence:
Elizabeth had
been at
Netherfield
long enough.
She attracted
him more than
he liked; and
Miss Bingley
was uncivil to
_her_ and more
teasing than
usual to
himself. He
wisely resolved
to be
particularly
careful that no
sign of
admiration
should _now_
escape
him--nothing
that could
elevate her
with the hope
of influencing
his felicity;
sensible that,
if such an idea
had been
suggested, his
behaviour
during the last
day must have
material weight
in confirming
or crushing it.
Steady to his
purpose, he
scarcely spoke
ten words to
her through the
whole of
Saturday: and
though they
were at one
time left by
themselves for
half an hour,
he adhered most
conscientiously
to his book,
and would not
even look at
her. On Sunday,
after morning
service, the
separation, so
agreeable to
almost all,
took place.
Miss Bingley’s
civility to
Elizabeth
increased at
last very
rapidly, as
well as her
affection for
Jane; and when
they parted,
after assuring
the latter of
the pleasure it
would always
give her to see
her either at
Longbourn or
Netherfield,
and embracing
her most
tenderly, she
even shook
hands with the
former.
Elizabeth took
leave of the
whole party in
the liveliest
spirits. They
were not
welcomed home
very cordially
by their
mother. Mrs.
Bennet wondered
at their
coming, and
thought them
very wrong to
give so much
trouble, and
was sure Jane
would have
caught cold
again. But
their father,
though very
laconic in his
expressions of
pleasure, was
really glad to
see them; he
had felt their
importance in
the family
circle. The
evening
conversation,
when they were
all assembled,
had lost much
of its
animation, and
almost all its
sense, by the
absence of Jane
and Elizabeth.
They found
Mary, as usual,
deep in the
study of
thorough bass
and human
nature; and had
some new
extracts to
admire and some
new
observations of
threadbare
morality to
listen to.
Catherine and
Lydia had
information for
them of a
different sort.
Much had been
done, and much
had been said
in the regiment
since the
preceding
Wednesday;
several of the
officers had
dined lately
with their
uncle; a
private had
been flogged;
and it had
actually been
hinted that
Colonel Forster
was going to be
married.

=====

During dinner,
Mr. Bennet
scarcely spoke
at all; but
when the
servants were
withdrawn, he
thought it time
to have some
conversation
with his guest,
and therefore
started a
subject in
which he
expected him to
shine, by
observing that
he seemed very
fortunate in
his patroness.
Lady Catherine
de Bourgh’s
attention to
his wishes, and
consideration
for his
comfort,
appeared very
remarkable. Mr.
Bennet could
not have chosen
better. Mr.
Collins was
eloquent in her
praise. The
subject
elevated him to
more than usual
solemnity of
manner; and
with a most
important
aspect he
protested that
he had never in
his life
witnessed such
behaviour in a
person of
rank--such
affability and
condescension,
as he had
himself
experienced
from Lady
Catherine. She
had been
graciously
pleased to
approve of both
the discourses
which he had
already had the
honour of
preaching
before her. She
had also asked
him twice to
dine at
Rosings, and
had sent for
him only the
Saturday
before, to make
up her pool of
quadrille in
the evening.
Lady Catherine
was reckoned
proud by many
people, he
knew, but _he_
had never seen
anything but
affability in
her. She had
always spoken
to him as she
would to any
other
gentleman; she
made not the
smallest
objection to
his joining in
the society of
the
neighbourhood,
nor to his
leaving his
parish
occasionally
for a week or
two to visit
his relations.
She had even
condescended to
advise him to
marry as soon
as he could,
provided he
chose with
discretion; and
had once paid
him a visit in
his humble
parsonage,
where she had
perfectly
approved all
the alterations
he had been
making, and had
even vouchsafed
to suggest some
herself,--some
shelves in the
closets
upstairs. “That
is all very
proper and
civil, I am
sure,” said
Mrs. Bennet,
“and I dare say
she is a very
agreeable
woman. It is a
pity that great
ladies in
general are not
more like her.
Does she live
near you, sir?”
“The garden in
which stands my
humble abode is
separated only
by a lane from
Rosings Park,
her Ladyship’s
residence.” “I
think you said
she was a
widow, sir? has
she any
family?” “She
has one only
daughter, the
heiress of
Rosings, and of
very extensive
property.”
“Ah,” cried
Mrs. Bennet,
shaking her
head, “then she
is better off
than many
girls. And what
sort of young
lady is she? Is
she handsome?”
“She is a most
charming young
lady, indeed.
Lady Catherine
herself says
that, in point
of true beauty,
Miss de Bourgh
is far superior
to the
handsomest of
her sex;
because there
is that in her
features which
marks the young
woman of
distinguished
birth. She is
unfortunately
of a sickly
constitution,
which has
prevented her
making that
progress in
many
accomplishments
which she could
not otherwise
have failed of,
as I am
informed by the
lady who
superintended
her education,
and who still
resides with
them. But she
is perfectly
amiable, and
often
condescends to
drive by my
humble abode in
her little
phaeton and
ponies.” “Has
she been
presented? I do
not remember
her name among
the ladies at
court.” “Her
indifferent
state of health
unhappily
prevents her
being in town;
and by that
means, as I
told Lady
Catherine
myself one day,
has deprived
the British
Court of its
brightest
ornament. Her
Ladyship seemed
pleased with
the idea; and
you may imagine
that I am happy
on every
occasion to
offer those
little delicate
compliments
which are
always
acceptable to
ladies. I have
more than once
observed to
Lady Catherine,
that her
charming
daughter seemed
born to be a
duchess; and
that the most
elevated rank,
instead of
giving her
consequence,
would be
adorned by her.
These are the
kind of little
things which
please her
Ladyship, and
it is a sort of
attention which
I conceive
myself
peculiarly
bound to pay.”
“You judge very
properly,” said
Mr. Bennet;
“and it is
happy for you
that you
possess the
talent of
flattering with
delicacy. May I
ask whether
these pleasing
attentions
proceed from
the impulse of
the moment, or
are the result
of previous
study?” “They
arise chiefly
from what is
passing at the
time; and
though I
sometimes amuse
myself with
suggesting and
arranging such
little elegant
compliments as
may be adapted
to ordinary
occasions, I
always wish to
give them as
unstudied an
air as
possible.” Mr.
Bennet’s
expectations
were fully
answered. His
cousin was as
absurd as he
had hoped; and
he listened to
him with the
keenest
enjoyment,
maintaining at
the same time
the most
resolute
composure of
countenance,
and, except in
an occasional
glance at
Elizabeth,
requiring no
partner in his
pleasure. By
tea-time,
however, the
dose had been
enough, and Mr.
Bennet was glad
to take his
guest into the
drawing-room
again, and when
tea was over,
glad to invite
him

to read aloud
to the ladies.
Mr. Collins
readily
assented, and a
book was
produced; but
on beholding it
(for everything
announced it to
be from a
circulating
library) he
started back,
and, begging
pardon,
protested that
he never read
novels. Kitty
stared at him,
and Lydia
exclaimed.
Other books
were produced,
and after some
deliberation he
chose
“Fordyce’s
Sermons.” Lydia
gaped as he
opened the
volume; and
before he had,
with very
monotonous
solemnity, read
three pages,
she interrupted
him with,-- “Do
you know,
mamma, that my
uncle Philips
talks of
turning away
Richard? and if
he does,
Colonel Forster
will hire him.
My aunt told me
so herself on
Saturday. I
shall walk to
Meryton
to-morrow to
hear more about
it, and to ask
when Mr. Denny
comes back from
town.” Lydia
was bid by her
two eldest
sisters to hold
her tongue; but
Mr. Collins,
much offended,
laid aside his
book, and
said,-- “I have
often observed
how little
young ladies
are interested
by books of a
serious stamp,
though written
solely for
their benefit.
It amazes me, I
confess; for
certainly there
can be nothing
so advantageous
to them as
instruction.
But I will no
longer
importune my
young cousin.”
Then, turning
to Mr. Bennet,
he offered
himself as his
antagonist at
backgammon. Mr.
Bennet accepted
the challenge,
observing that
he acted very
wisely in
leaving the
girls to their
own trifling
amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and
her daughters
apologized most
civilly for
Lydia’s
interruption,
and promised
that it should
not occur
again, if he
would resume
his book; but
Mr. Collins,
after assuring
them that he
bore his young
cousin no
ill-will, and
should never
resent her
behaviour as
any affront,
seated himself
at another
table with Mr.
Bennet, and
prepared for
backgammon.

=====

Elizabeth
related to
Jane, the next
day, what had
passed between
Mr. Wickham and
herself. Jane
listened with
astonishment
and concern:
she knew not
how to believe
that Mr. Darcy
could be so
unworthy of Mr.
Bingley’s
regard; and yet
it was not in
her nature to
question the
veracity of a
young man of
such amiable
appearance as
Wickham. The
possibility of
his having
really endured
such unkindness
was enough to
interest all
her tender
feelings; and
nothing
therefore
remained to be
done but to
think well of
them both, to
defend the
conduct of
each, and throw
into the
account of
accident or
mistake
whatever could
not be
otherwise
explained.
“They have
both,” said
she, “been
deceived, I
dare say, in
some way or
other, of which
we can form no
idea.
Interested
people have
perhaps
misrepresented
each to the
other. It is,
in short,
impossible for
us to
conjecture the
causes or
circumstances
which may have
alienated them,
without actual
blame on either
side.” “Very
true, indeed;
and now, my
dear Jane, what
have you got to
say in behalf
of the
interested
people who have
probably been
concerned in
the business?
Do clear
_them_, too, or
we shall be
obliged to
think ill of
somebody.”
“Laugh as much
as you choose,
but you will
not laugh me
out of my
opinion. My
dearest Lizzy,
do but consider
in what a
disgraceful
light it places
Mr. Darcy, to
be treating his
father’s
favourite in
such a
manner,--one
whom his father
had promised to
provide for. It
is impossible.
No man of
common
humanity, no
man who had any
value for his
character,
could be
capable of it.
Can his most
intimate
friends be so
excessively
deceived in
him? Oh no.” “I
can much more
easily believe
Mr. Bingley’s
being imposed
on than that
Mr. Wickham
should invent
such a history
of himself as
he gave me last
night; names,
facts,
everything
mentioned
without
ceremony. If it
be not so, let
Mr. Darcy
contradict it.
Besides, there
was truth in
his looks.” “It
is difficult,
indeed--it is
distressing.
One does not
know what to
think.” “I beg
your
pardon;--one
knows exactly
what to think.”
But Jane could
think with
certainty on
only one
point,--that
Mr. Bingley, if
he _had been_
imposed on,
would have much
to suffer when
the affair
became public.
The two young
ladies were
summoned from
the shrubbery,
where this
conversation
passed, by the
arrival of some
of the very
persons of whom
they had been
speaking; Mr.
Bingley and his
sisters came to
give their
personal
invitation for
the long
expected ball
at Netherfield,
which was fixed
for the
following
Tuesday. The
two ladies were
delighted to
see their dear
friend again,
called it an
age since they
had met, and
repeatedly
asked what she
had been doing
with herself
since their
separation. To
the rest of the
family they
paid little
attention;
avoiding Mrs.
Bennet as much
as possible,
saying not much
to Elizabeth,
and nothing at
all to the
others. They
were soon gone
again, rising
from their
seats with an
activity which
took their
brother by
surprise, and
hurrying off as
if eager to
escape from
Mrs. Bennet’s
civilities. The
prospect of the
Netherfield
ball was
extremely
agreeable to
every female of
the family.
Mrs. Bennet
chose to
consider it as
given in
compliment to
her eldest
daughter, and
was
particularly
flattered by
receiving the
invitation from
Mr. Bingley
himself,
instead of a
ceremonious
card. Jane
pictured to
herself a happy
evening in the
society of her
two friends,
and the
attentions of
their brother;
and Elizabeth
thought with
pleasure of
dancing a great
deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of
seeing a
confirmation of
everything in
Mr. Darcy’s
look and
behaviour. The
happiness
anticipated by
Catherine and
Lydia depended
less on any
single event,
or any
particular
person; for
though they
each, like
Elizabeth,
meant to dance
half the
evening with
Mr. Wickham, he
was by no means
the only
partner who
could satisfy
them, and a
ball was, at
any rate, a
ball. And even
Mary could
assure her
family that she
had no
disinclination
for it. “While
I can have my
mornings to
myself,” said
she, “it is
enough. I think
it is no
sacrifice to
join
occasionally in
evening
engagements.
Society has
claims on us
all; and I
profess myself
one of those
who consider
intervals of
recreation and
amusement as
desirable for
everybody.”
Elizabeth’s
spirits were so
high on the
occasion, that
though she did
not often speak
unnecessarily
to Mr. Collins,
she could not
help asking him
whether he
intended to
accept Mr.
Bingley’s
invitation, and
if he did,
whether he
would think it
proper to join
in the
evening’s
amusement; and
she was rather
surprised to
find that he
entertained no
scruple
whatever on
that head, and
was very far
from dreading a
rebuke, either
from the
Archbishop or
Lady Catherine
de Bourgh, by
venturing to
dance. “I am by
no means of
opinion, I
assure you,”
said he, “that
a ball of this
kind, given by
a young man of
character, to
respectable
people, can
have any evil
tendency; and I
am so far from
objecting to
dancing myself,
that I shall
hope to be
honoured with
the hands of
all my fair
cousins in the
course of the
evening; and I
take this
opportunity of
soliciting
yours, Miss
Elizabeth, for
the two first
dances
especially; a
preference
which I trust
my cousin Jane
will attribute
to the right
cause, and not
to any
disrespect for
her.” Elizabeth
felt herself
completely
taken in. She
had fully
proposed being
engaged by
Wickham for
those very
dances; and to
have Mr.
Collins
instead!--her
liveliness had
been never
worse timed.
There was no
help for it,
however. Mr.
Wickham’s
happiness and
her own was
perforce
delayed a
little longer,
and Mr.
Collins’s
proposal
accepted with
as good a grace
as she could.
She was not the
better pleased
with his
gallantry, from
the idea it
suggested of
something more.
It now first
struck her,
that _she_ was
selected from
among her
sisters as
worthy of being
the mistress of
Hunsford
Parsonage, and
of assisting to
form a
quadrille table
at Rosings, in
the absence of
more eligible
visitors. The
idea soon
reached to
conviction, as
she observed
his increasing
civilities
towards
herself, and
heard his
frequent
attempt at a
compliment on
her wit and
vivacity; and
though more
astonished than
gratified
herself by this
effect of her
charms, it was
not long before
her mother gave
her to
understand that
the probability
of their
marriage was
exceedingly
agreeable to
_her_.
Elizabeth,
however, did
not choose to
take the hint,
being well
aware that a
serious dispute
must be the
consequence of
any reply. Mr.
Collins might
never make the
offer, and,
till he did, it
was useless to
quarrel about
him. If there
had not been a
Netherfield
ball to prepare
for and talk
of, the younger
Miss Bennets
would have been
in a pitiable
state at this
time; for, from
the day of the
invitation to
the day of the
ball, there was
such a
succession of
rain as
prevented their
walking to
Meryton once.
No aunt, no
officers, no
news could be
sought after;
the very
shoe-roses for
Netherfield
were got by
proxy. Even
Elizabeth might
have found some
trial of her
patience in
weather which
totally
suspended the
improvement of
her
acquaintance
with Mr.
Wickham; and
nothing less
than a dance on
Tuesday could
have made such
a Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday, and
Monday
endurable to
Kitty and
Lydia.

=====

Mr. Collins was
not left long
to the silent
contemplation
of his
successful
love; for Mrs.
Bennet, having
dawdled about
in the
vestibule to
watch for the
end of the
conference, no
sooner saw
Elizabeth open
the door and
with quick step
pass her
towards the
staircase, than
she entered the
breakfast-room,
and
congratulated
both him and
herself in warm
terms on the
happy prospect
of their nearer
connection. Mr.
Collins
received and
returned these
felicitations
with equal
pleasure, and
then proceeded
to relate the
particulars of
their
interview, with
the result of
which he
trusted he had
every reason to
be satisfied,
since the
refusal which
his cousin had
steadfastly
given him would
naturally flow
from her
bashful modesty
and the genuine
delicacy of her
character. This
information,
however,
startled Mrs.
Bennet: she
would have been
glad to be
equally
satisfied that
her daughter
had meant to
encourage him
by protesting
against his
proposals, but
she dared not
believe it, and
could not help
saying so. “But
depend upon it,
Mr. Collins,”
she added,
“that Lizzy
shall be
brought to
reason. I will
speak to her
about it myself
directly. She
is a very
headstrong,
foolish girl,
and does not
know her own
interest; but I
will _make_ her
know it.”
“Pardon me for
interrupting
you, madam,”
cried Mr.
Collins; “but
if she is
really
headstrong and
foolish, I know
not whether she
would
altogether be a
very desirable
wife to a man
in my
situation, who
naturally looks
for happiness
in the marriage
state. If,
therefore, she
actually
persists in
rejecting my
suit, perhaps
it were better
not to force
her into
accepting me,
because, if
liable to such
defects of
temper, she
could not
contribute much
to my
felicity.”
“Sir, you quite
misunderstand
me,” said Mrs.
Bennet,
alarmed. “Lizzy
is only
headstrong in
such matters as
these. In
everything else
she is as
good-natured a
girl as ever
lived. I will
go directly to
Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very
soon settle it
with her, I am
sure.” She
would not give
him time to
reply, but
hurrying
instantly to
her husband,
called out, as
she entered the
library,-- “Oh,
Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted
immediately; we
are all in an
uproar. You
must come and
make Lizzy
marry Mr.
Collins, for
she vows she
will not have
him; and if you
do not make
haste he will
change his mind
and not have
_her_.” Mr.
Bennet raised
his eyes from
his book as she
entered, and
fixed them on
her face with a
calm unconcern,
which was not
in the least
altered by her
communication.
“I have not the
pleasure of
understanding
you,” said he,
when she had
finished her
speech. “Of
what are you
talking?” “Of
Mr. Collins and
Lizzy. Lizzy
declares she
will not have
Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins
begins to say
that he will
not have
Lizzy.” “And
what am I to do
on the
occasion? It
seems a
hopeless
business.”
“Speak to Lizzy
about it
yourself. Tell
her that you
insist upon her
marrying him.”
“Let her be
called down.
She shall hear
my opinion.”
Mrs. Bennet
rang the bell,
and Miss
Elizabeth was
summoned to the
library. “Come
here, child,”
cried her
father as she
appeared. “I
have sent for
you on an
affair of
importance. I
understand that
Mr. Collins has
made you an
offer of
marriage. Is it
true?”
Elizabeth
replied that it
was. “Very
well--and this
offer of
marriage you
have refused?”
“I have, sir.”
“Very well. We
now come to the
point. Your
mother insists
upon your
accepting it.
Is it not so,
Mrs. Bennet?”
“Yes, or I will
never see her
again.” “An
unhappy
alternative is
before you,
Elizabeth. From
this day you
must be a
stranger to one
of your
parents. Your
mother will
never see you
again if you do
_not_ marry Mr.
Collins, and I
will never see
you again if
you _do_.”
Elizabeth could
not but smile
at such a
conclusion of
such a
beginning; but
Mrs. Bennet,
who had
persuaded
herself that
her husband
regarded the
affair as she
wished, was
excessively
disappointed.
“What do you
mean, Mr.
Bennet, by
talking in this
way? You
promised me to
_insist_ upon
her marrying
him.” “My
dear,” replied
her husband, “I
have two small
favours to
request. First,
that you will
allow me the
free use of my
understanding
on the present
occasion; and,
secondly, of my
room. I shall
be glad to have
the library to
myself as soon
as may be.” Not
yet, however,
in spite of her
disappointment
in her husband,
did Mrs. Bennet
give up the
point. She
talked to
Elizabeth again
and again;
coaxed and
threatened her
by turns. She
endeavoured to
secure Jane in
her interest,
but Jane, with
all possible
mildness,
declined
interfering;
and Elizabeth,
sometimes with
real
earnestness,
and sometimes
with playful
gaiety, replied
to her attacks.
Though her
manner varied,
however, her
determination
never did. Mr.
Collins,
meanwhile, was
meditating in
solitude on
what had
passed. He
thought too
well of himself
to comprehend
on what motive
his cousin
could refuse
him; and though
his pride was
hurt, he
suffered in no
other way. His
regard for her
was quite
imaginary; and
the possibility
of her
deserving her
mother’s
reproach
prevented his
feeling any
regret. While
the family were
in this
confusion,
Charlotte Lucas
came to spend
the day with
them. She was
met in the
vestibule by
Lydia, who,
flying to her,
cried in a half
whisper, “I am
glad you are
come, for there
is such fun
here! What do
you think has
happened this
morning? Mr.
Collins has
made an offer
to Lizzy, and
she will not
have him.”

=====

Charlotte had
hardly time to
answer before
they were
joined by
Kitty, who came
to tell the
same news; and
no sooner had
they entered
the
breakfast-room,
where Mrs.
Bennet was
alone, than she
likewise began
on the subject,
calling on Miss
Lucas for her
compassion, and
entreating her
to persuade her
friend Lizzy to
comply with the
wishes of her
family. “Pray
do, my dear
Miss Lucas,”
she added, in a
melancholy
tone; “for
nobody is on my
side, nobody
takes part with
me; I am
cruelly used,
nobody feels
for my poor
nerves.”
Charlotte’s
reply was
spared by the
entrance of
Jane and
Elizabeth. “Ay,
there she
comes,”
continued Mrs.
Bennet,
“looking as
unconcerned as
may be, and
caring no more
for us than if
we were at
York, provided
she can have
her own way.
But I tell you
what, Miss
Lizzy, if you
take it into
your head to go
on refusing
every offer of
marriage in
this way, you
will never get
a husband at
all--and I am
sure I do not
know who is to
maintain you
when your
father is dead.
_I_ shall not
be able to keep
you--and so I
warn you. I
have done with
you from this
very day. I
told you in the
library, you
know, that I
should never
speak to you
again, and you
will find me as
good as my
word. I have no
pleasure in
talking to
undutiful
children. Not
that I have
much pleasure,
indeed, in
talking to
anybody. People
who suffer as I
do from nervous
complaints can
have no great
inclination for
talking. Nobody
can tell what I
suffer! But it
is always so.
Those who do
not complain
are never
pitied.” Her
daughters
listened in
silence to this
effusion,
sensible that
any attempt to
reason with or
soothe her
would only
increase the
irritation. She
talked on,
therefore,
without
interruption
from any of
them till they
were joined by
Mr. Collins,
who entered
with an air
more stately
than usual, and
on perceiving
whom, she said
to the girls,--
“Now, I do
insist upon it,
that you, all
of you, hold
your tongues,
and let Mr.
Collins and me
have a little
conversation
together.”
Elizabeth
passed quietly
out of the
room, Jane and
Kitty followed,
but Lydia stood
her ground,
determined to
hear all she
could; and
Charlotte,
detained first
by the civility
of Mr. Collins,
whose inquiries
after herself
and all her
family were
very minute,
and then by a
little
curiosity,
satisfied
herself with
walking to the
window and
pretending not
to hear. In a
doleful voice
Mrs. Bennet
thus began the
projected
conversation:--
“Oh, Mr.
Collins!” “My
dear madam,”
replied he,
“let us be for
ever silent on
this point. Far
be it from me,”
he presently
continued, in a
voice that
marked his
displeasure,
“to resent the
behaviour of
your daughter.
Resignation to
inevitable
evils is the
duty of us all:
the peculiar
duty of a young
man who has
been so
fortunate as I
have been, in
early
preferment;
and, I trust, I
am resigned.
Perhaps not the
less so from
feeling a doubt
of my positive
happiness had
my fair cousin
honoured me
with her hand;
for I have
often observed,
that
resignation is
never so
perfect as when
the blessing
denied begins
to lose
somewhat of its
value in our
estimation. You
will not, I
hope, consider
me as showing
any disrespect
to your family,
my dear madam,
by thus
withdrawing my
pretensions to
your daughter’s
favour, without
having paid
yourself and
Mr. Bennet the
compliment of
requesting you
to interpose
your authority
in my behalf.
My conduct may,
I fear, be
objectionable
in having
accepted my
dismission from
your daughter’s
lips instead of
your own; but
we are all
liable to
error. I have
certainly meant
well through
the whole
affair. My
object has been
to secure an
amiable
companion for
myself, with
due
consideration
for the
advantage of
all your
family; and if
my _manner_ has
been at all
reprehensible,
I here beg
leave to
apologize.”

=====

The Bennets
were engaged to
dine with the
Lucases; and
again, during
the chief of
the day, was
Miss Lucas so
kind as to
listen to Mr.
Collins.
Elizabeth took
an opportunity
of thanking
her. “It keeps
him in good
humour,” said
she, “and I am
more obliged to
you than I can
express.”
Charlotte
assured her
friend of her
satisfaction in
being useful,
and that it
amply repaid
her for the
little
sacrifice of
her time. This
was very
amiable; but
Charlotte’s
kindness
extended
farther than
Elizabeth had
any conception
of:--its object
was nothing
less than to
secure her from
any return of
Mr. Collins’s
addresses, by
engaging them
towards
herself. Such
was Miss
Lucas’s scheme;
and appearances
were so
favourable,
that when they
parted at
night, she
would have felt
almost sure of
success if he
had not been to
leave
Hertfordshire
so very soon.
But here she
did injustice
to the fire and
independence of
his character;
for it led him
to escape out
of Longbourn
House the next
morning with
admirable
slyness, and
hasten to Lucas
Lodge to throw
himself at her
feet. He was
anxious to
avoid the
notice of his
cousins, from a
conviction
that, if they
saw him depart,
they could not
fail to
conjecture his
design, and he
was not willing
to have the
attempt known
till its
success could
be known
likewise; for,
though feeling
almost secure,
and with
reason, for
Charlotte had
been tolerably
encouraging, he
was
comparatively
diffident since
the adventure
of Wednesday.
His reception,
however, was of
the most
flattering
kind. Miss
Lucas perceived
him from an
upper window as
he walked
towards the
house, and
instantly set
out to meet him
accidentally in
the lane. But
little had she
dared to hope
that so much
love and
eloquence
awaited her
there. In as
short a time as
Mr. Collins’s
long speeches
would allow,
everything was
settled between
them to the
satisfaction of
both; and as
they entered
the house, he
earnestly
entreated her
to name the day
that was to
make him the
happiest of
men; and though
such a
solicitation
must be waived
for the
present, the
lady felt no
inclination to
trifle with his
happiness. The
stupidity with
which he was
favoured by
nature must
guard his
courtship from
any charm that
could make a
woman wish for
its
continuance;
and Miss Lucas,
who accepted
him solely from
the pure and
disinterested
desire of an
establishment,
cared not how
soon that
establishment
were gained.
Sir William and
Lady Lucas were
speedily
applied to for
their consent;
and it was
bestowed with a
most joyful
alacrity. Mr.
Collins’s
present
circumstances
made it a most
eligible match
for their
daughter, to
whom they could
give little
fortune; and
his prospects
of future
wealth were
exceedingly
fair. Lady
Lucas began
directly to
calculate, with
more interest
than the matter
had ever ]
excited before,
how many years
longer Mr.
Bennet was
likely to live;
and Sir William
gave it as his
decided
opinion, that
whenever Mr.
Collins should
be in
possession of
the Longbourn
estate, it
would be highly
expedient that
both he and his
wife should
make their
appearance at
St. James’s.
The whole
family in short
were properly
overjoyed on
the occasion.
The younger
girls formed
hopes of
_coming out_ a
year or two
sooner than
they might
otherwise have
done; and the
boys were
relieved from
their
apprehension of
Charlotte’s
dying an old
maid. Charlotte
herself was
tolerably
composed. She
had gained her
point, and had
time to
consider of it.
Her reflections
were in general
satisfactory.
Mr. Collins, to
be sure, was
neither
sensible nor
agreeable: his
society was
irksome, and
his attachment
to her must be
imaginary. But
still he would
be her husband.
Without
thinking highly
either of men
or of
matrimony,
marriage had
always been her
object: it was
the only
honourable
provision for
well-educated
young women of
small fortune,
and, however
uncertain of
giving
happiness, must
be their
pleasantest
preservative
from want. This
preservative
she had now
obtained; and
at the age of
twenty-seven,
without having
ever been
handsome, she
felt all the
good luck of
it. The least
agreeable
circumstance in
the business
was the
surprise it
must occasion
to Elizabeth
Bennet, whose
friendship she
valued beyond
that of any
other person.
Elizabeth would
wonder, and
probably would
blame her; and
though her
resolution was
not to be
shaken, her
feelings must
be hurt by such
a
disapprobation.
She resolved to
give her the
information
herself; and
therefore
charged Mr.
Collins, when
he returned to
Longbourn to
dinner, to drop
no hint of what
had passed
before any of
the family. A
promise of
secrecy was of
course very
dutifully
given, but it
could not be
kept without
difficulty; for
the curiosity
excited by his
long absence
burst forth in
such very
direct
questions on
his return, as
required some
ingenuity to
evade, and he
was at the same
time exercising
great
self-denial,
for he was
longing to
publish his
prosperous
love. As he was
to begin his
journey too
early on the
morrow to see
any of the
family, the
ceremony of
leave-taking
was performed
when the ladies
moved for the
night; and Mrs.
Bennet, with
great
politeness and
cordiality,
said how happy
they should be
to see him at
Longbourn
again, whenever
his other
engagements
might allow him
to visit them.
“My dear
madam,” he
replied, “this
invitation is
particularly
gratifying,
because it is
what I have
been hoping to
receive; and
you may be very
certain that I
shall avail
myself of it as
soon as
possible.” They
were all
astonished; and
Mr. Bennet, who
could by no
means wish for
so speedy a
return,
immediately
said,-- “But is
there not
danger of Lady
Catherine’s
disapprobation
here, my good
sir? You had
better neglect
your relations
than run the
risk of
offending your
patroness.” “My
dear sir,”
replied Mr.
Collins, “I am
particularly
obliged to you
for this
friendly
caution, and
you may depend
upon my not
taking so
material a step
without her
Ladyship’s
concurrence.”
“You cannot be
too much on
your guard.
Risk anything
rather than her
displeasure;
and if you find
it likely to be
raised by your
coming to us
again, which I
should think
exceedingly
probable, stay
quietly at
home, and be
satisfied that
_we_ shall take
no offence.”
“Believe me, my
dear sir, my
gratitude is
warmly excited
by such
affectionate
attention; and,
depend upon it,
you will
speedily
receive from me
a letter of
thanks for this
as well as for
every other
mark of your
regard during
my stay in
Hertfordshire.
As for my fair
cousins, though
my absence may
not be long
enough to
render it
necessary, I
shall now take
the liberty of
wishing them
health and
happiness, not
excepting my
cousin
Elizabeth.”
With proper
civilities, the
ladies then
withdrew; all
of them equally
surprised to
find that he
meditated a
quick return.
Mrs. Bennet
wished to
understand by
it that he
thought of
paying his
addresses to
one of her
younger girls,
and Mary might
have been
prevailed on to
accept him. She
rated his
abilities much
higher than any
of the others:
there was a
solidity in his
reflections
which often
struck her; and
though by no
means so clever
as herself, she
thought that,
if encouraged
to read and
improve himself
by such an
example as
hers, he might
become a very
agreeable
companion. But
on the
following
morning every
hope of this
kind was done
away. Miss
Lucas called
soon after
breakfast, and
in a private
conference with
Elizabeth
related the
event of the
day before. The
possibility of
Mr. Collins’s
fancying
himself in love
with her friend
had once
occurred to
Elizabeth
within the last
day or two: but
that Charlotte
could encourage
him seemed
almost as far
from
possibility as
that she could
encourage him
herself; and
her
astonishment
was
consequently so
great as to
overcome at
first the
bounds of
decorum, and
she could not
help crying
out,-- “Engaged
to Mr. Collins!
my dear
Charlotte,
impossible!”
The steady
countenance
which Miss
Lucas had
commanded in
telling her
story gave way
to a momentary
confusion here
on receiving so
direct a
reproach;
though, as it
was no more
than she
expected, she
soon regained
her composure,
and calmly
replied,-- “Why
should you be
surprised, my
dear Eliza? Do
you think it
incredible that
Mr. Collins
should be able
to procure any
woman’s good
opinion,
because he was
not so happy as
to succeed with
you?” But
Elizabeth had
now recollected
herself; and,
making a strong
effort for it,
was able to
assure her,
with tolerable
firmness, that
the prospect of
their
relationship
was highly
grateful to
her, and that
she wished her
all imaginable
happiness. “I
see what you
are feeling,”
replied
Charlotte; “you
must be
surprised, very
much surprised,
so lately as
Mr. Collins was
wishing to
marry you. But
when you have
had time to
think it all
over, I hope
you will be
satisfied with
what I have
done. I am not
romantic, you
know. I never
was. I ask only
a comfortable
home; and,
considering Mr.
Collins’s
character,
connections,
and situation
in life, I am
convinced that
my chance of
happiness with
him is as fair
as most people
can boast on
entering the
marriage
state.”
Elizabeth
quietly
answered
“undoubtedly;”
and, after an
awkward pause,
they returned
to the rest of
the family.
Charlotte did
not stay much
longer; and
Elizabeth was
then left to
reflect on what
she had heard.
It was a long
time before she
became at all
reconciled to
the idea of so
unsuitable a
match. The
strangeness of
Mr. Collins’s
making two
offers of
marriage within
three days was
nothing in
comparison of
his being now
accepted. She
had always felt
that
Charlotte’s
opinion of
matrimony was
not exactly
like her own;
but she could
not have
supposed it
possible that,
when called
into action,
she would have
sacrificed
every better
feeling to
worldly
advantage.
Charlotte, the
wife of Mr.
Collins, was a
most
humiliating
picture! And to
the pang of a
friend
disgracing
herself, and
sunk in her
esteem, was
added the
distressing
conviction that
it was
impossible for
that friend to
be tolerably
happy in the
lot she had
chosen.

=====

Mrs. Bennet was
really in a
most pitiable
state. The very
mention of
anything
concerning the
match threw her
into an agony
of ill-humour,
and wherever
she went she
was sure of
hearing it
talked of. The
sight of Miss
Lucas was
odious to her.
As her
successor in
that house, she
regarded her
with jealous
abhorrence.
Whenever
Charlotte came
to see them,
she concluded
her to be
anticipating
the hour of
possession; and
whenever she
spoke in a low
voice to Mr.
Collins, was
convinced that
they were
talking of the
Longbourn
estate, and
resolving to
turn herself
and her
daughters out
of the house as
soon as Mr.
Bennet was
dead. She
complained
bitterly of all
this to her
husband.
“Indeed, Mr.
Bennet,” said
she, “it is
very hard to
think that
Charlotte Lucas
should ever be
mistress of
this house,
that _I_ should
be forced to
make way for
_her_, and live
to see her take
my place in
it!” “My dear,
do not give way
to such gloomy
thoughts. Let
us hope for
better things.
Let us flatter
ourselves that
_I_ may be the
survivor.” This
was not very
consoling to
Mrs. Bennet;
and, therefore,
instead of
making any
answer, she
went on as
before. “I
cannot bear to
think that they
should have all
this estate. If
it was not for
the entail, I
should not mind
it.” “What
should not you
mind?” “I
should not mind
anything at
all.” “Let us
be thankful
that you are
preserved from
a state of such
insensibility.”
“I never can be
thankful, Mr.
Bennet, for
anything about
the entail. How
anyone could
have the
conscience to
entail away an
estate from
one’s own
daughters I
cannot
understand; and
all for the
sake of Mr.
Collins, too!
Why should _he_
have it more
than anybody
else?” “I leave
it to yourself
to determine,”
said Mr.
Bennet.

=====

After a week
spent in
professions of
love and
schemes of
felicity, Mr.
Collins was
called from his
amiable
Charlotte by
the arrival of
Saturday. The
pain of
separation,
however, might
be alleviated
on his side by
preparations
for the
reception of
his bride, as
he had reason
to hope, that
shortly after
his next return
into
Hertfordshire,
the day would
be fixed that
was to make him
the happiest of
men. He took
leave of his
relations at
Longbourn with
as much
solemnity as
before; wished
his fair
cousins health
and happiness
again, and
promised their
father another
letter of
thanks. On the
following
Monday, Mrs.
Bennet had the
pleasure of
receiving her
brother and his
wife, who came,
as usual, to
spend the
Christmas at
Longbourn. Mr.
Gardiner was a
sensible,
gentlemanlike
man, greatly
superior to his
sister, as well
by nature as
education. The
Netherfield
ladies would
have had
difficulty in
believing that
a man who lived
by trade, and
within view of
his own
warehouses,
could have been
so well-bred
and agreeable.
Mrs. Gardiner,
who was several
years younger
than Mrs.
Bennet and Mrs.
Philips, was an
amiable,
intelligent,
elegant woman,
and a great
favourite with
her Longbourn
nieces. Between
the two eldest
and herself
especially,
there subsisted
a very
particular
regard. They
had frequently
been staying
with her in
town. The first
part of Mrs.
Gardiner’s
business, on
her arrival,
was to
distribute her
presents and
describe the
newest
fashions. When
this was done,
she had a less
active part to
play. It became
her turn to
listen. Mrs.
Bennet had many
grievances to
relate, and
much to
complain of.
They had all
been very
ill-used since
she last saw
her sister. Two
of her girls
had been on the
point of
marriage, and
after all there
was nothing in
it. “I do not
blame Jane,”
she continued,
“for Jane would
have got Mr.
Bingley if she
could. But,
Lizzy! Oh,
sister! it is
very hard to
think that she
might have been
Mr. Collins’s
wife by this
time, had not
it been for her
own
perverseness.
He made her an
offer in this
very room, and
she refused
him. The
consequence of
it is, that
Lady Lucas will
have a daughter
married before
I have, and
that Longbourn
estate is just
as much
entailed as
ever. The
Lucases are
very artful
people, indeed,
sister. They
are all for
what they can
get. I am sorry
to say it of
them, but so it
is. It makes me
very nervous
and poorly, to
be thwarted so
in my own
family, and to
have neighbours
who think of
themselves
before anybody
else. However,
your coming
just at this
time is the
greatest of
comforts, and I
am very glad to
hear what you
tell us of long
sleeves.” Mrs.
Gardiner, to
whom the chief
of this news
had been given
before, in the
course of Jane
and Elizabeth’s
correspondence
with her, made
her sister a
slight answer,
and, in
compassion to
her nieces,
turned the
conversation.
When alone with
Elizabeth
afterwards, she
spoke more on
the subject.
“It seems
likely to have
been a
desirable match
for Jane,” said
she. “I am
sorry it went
off. But these
things happen
so often! A
young man, such
as you describe
Mr. Bingley, so
easily falls in
love with a
pretty girl for
a few weeks,
and, when
accident
separates them,
so easily
forgets her,
that these sort
of
inconstancies
are very
frequent.” ]
“An excellent
consolation in
its way,” said
Elizabeth; “but
it will not do
for _us_. We do
not suffer by
accident. It
does not often
happen that the
interference of
friends will
persuade a
young man of
independent
fortune to
think no more
of a girl whom
he was
violently in
love with only
a few days
before.” “But
that expression
of ‘violently
in love’ is so
hackneyed, so
doubtful, so
indefinite,
that it gives
me very little
idea. It is as
often applied
to feelings
which arise
only from a
half hour’s
acquaintance,
as to a real,
strong
attachment.
Pray, how
_violent was_
Mr. Bingley’s
love?” “I never
saw a more
promising
inclination; he
was growing
quite
inattentive to
other people,
and wholly
engrossed by
her. Every time
they met, it
was more
decided and
remarkable. At
his own ball he
offended two or
three young
ladies by not
asking them to
dance; and I
spoke to him
twice myself
without
receiving an
answer. Could
there be finer
symptoms? Is
not general
incivility the
very essence of
love?” “Oh,
yes! of that
kind of love
which I suppose
him to have
felt. Poor
Jane! I am
sorry for her,
because, with
her
disposition,
she may not get
over it
immediately. It
had better have
happened to
_you_, Lizzy;
you would have
laughed
yourself out of
it sooner. But
do you think
she would be
prevailed on to
go back with
us? Change of
scene might be
of service--and
perhaps a
little relief
from home may
be as useful as
anything.”
Elizabeth was
exceedingly
pleased with
this proposal,
and felt
persuaded of
her sister’s
ready
acquiescence.
“I hope,” added
Mrs. Gardiner,
“that no
consideration
with regard to
this young man
will influence
her. We live in
so different a
part of town,
all our
connections are
so different,
and, as you
well know, we
go out so
little, that it
is very
improbable they
should meet at
all, unless he
really comes to
see her.” “And
_that_ is quite
impossible; for
he is now in
the custody of
his friend, and
Mr. Darcy would
no more suffer
him to call on
Jane in such a
part of London!
My dear aunt,
how could you
think of it?
Mr. Darcy may,
perhaps, have
_heard_ of such
a place as
Gracechurch
Street, but he
would hardly
think a month’s
ablution enough
to cleanse him
from its
impurities,
were he once to
enter it; and,
depend upon it,
Mr. Bingley
never stirs
without him.”
“So much the
better. I hope
they will not
meet at all.
But does not
Jane correspond
with his
sister? _She_
will not be
able to help
calling.” “She
will drop the
acquaintance
entirely.” But,
in spite of the
certainty in
which Elizabeth
affected to
place this
point, as well
as the still
more
interesting one
of Bingley’s
being withheld
from seeing
Jane, she felt
a solicitude on
the subject
which convinced
her, on
examination,
that she did
not consider it
entirely
hopeless. It
was possible,
and sometimes
she thought it
probable, that
his affection
might be
re-animated,
and the
influence of
his friends
successfully
combated by the
more natural
influence of
Jane’s
attractions.
Miss Bennet
accepted her
aunt’s
invitation with
pleasure; and
the Bingleys
were no
otherwise in
her thoughts at
the same time
than as she
hoped, by
Caroline’s not
living in the
same house with
her brother,
she might
occasionally
spend a morning
with her,
without any
danger of
seeing him. The
Gardiners
stayed a week
at Longbourn;
and what with
the Philipses,
the Lucases,
and the
officers, there
was not a day
without its
engagement.
Mrs. Bennet had
so carefully
provided for
the
entertainment
of her brother
and sister,
that they did
not once sit
down to a
family dinner.
When the
engagement was
for home, some
of the officers
always made
part of it, of
which officers
Mr. Wickham was
sure to be one;
and on these
occasions Mrs.
Gardiner,
rendered
suspicious by
Elizabeth’s
warm
commendation of
him, narrowly
observed them
both. Without
supposing them,
from what she
saw, to be very
seriously in
love, their
preference of
each other was
plain enough to
make her a
little uneasy;
and she
resolved to
speak to
Elizabeth on
the subject
before she left
Hertfordshire,
and represent
to her the
imprudence of
encouraging
such an
attachment. To
Mrs. Gardiner,
Wickham had one
means of
affording
pleasure,
unconnected
with his
general powers.
About ten or a
dozen years
ago, before her
marriage, she
had spent a
considerable
time in that
very part of
Derbyshire to
which he
belonged. They
had, therefore,
many
acquaintance in
common; and,
though Wickham
had been little
there since the
death of
Darcy’s father,
five years
before, it was
yet in his
power to give
her fresher
intelligence of
her former
friends than
she had been in
the way of
procuring. Mrs.
Gardiner had
seen Pemberley,
and known the
late Mr. Darcy
by character
perfectly well.
Here,
consequently,
was an
inexhaustible
subject of
discourse. In
comparing her
recollection of
Pemberley with
the minute
description
which Wickham
could give, and
in bestowing
her tribute of
praise on the
character of
its late
possessor, she
was delighting
both him and
herself. On
being made
acquainted with
the present Mr.
Darcy’s
treatment of
him, she tried
to remember
something of
that
gentleman’s
reputed
disposition,
when quite a
lad, which
might agree
with it; and
was confident,
at last, that
she recollected
having heard
Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly
spoken of as a
very proud,
ill-natured
boy.

=====

Every object in
the next day’s
journey was new
and interesting
to Elizabeth;
and her spirits
were in a state
of enjoyment;
for she had
seen her sister
looking so well
as to banish
all fear for
her health, and
the prospect of
her northern
tour was a
constant source
of delight.
When they left
the high road
for the lane to
Hunsford, every
eye was in
search of the
Parsonage, and
every turning
expected to
bring it in
view. The
paling of
Rosings park
was their
boundary on one
side. Elizabeth
smiled at the
recollection of
all that she
had heard of
its
inhabitants. At
length the
Parsonage was
discernible.
The garden
sloping to the
road, the house
standing in it,
the green pales
and the laurel
hedge,
everything
declared they
were arriving.
Mr. Collins and
Charlotte
appeared at the
door, and the
carriage
stopped at the
small gate,
which led by a
short gravel
walk to the
house, amidst
the nods and
smiles of the
whole party. In
a moment they
were all out of
the chaise,
rejoicing at
the sight of
each other.
Mrs. Collins
welcomed her
friend with the
liveliest
pleasure, and
Elizabeth was
more and more
satisfied with
coming, when
she found
herself so
affectionately
received. She
saw instantly
that her
cousin’s
manners were
not altered by
his marriage:
his formal
civility was
just what it
had been; and
he detained her
some minutes at
the gate to
hear and
satisfy his
inquiries after
all her family.
They were then,
with no other
delay than his
pointing out
the neatness of
the entrance,
taken into the
house; and as
soon as they
were in the
parlour, he
welcomed them a
second time,
with
ostentatious
formality, to
his humble
abode, and
punctually
repeated all
his wife’s
offers of
refreshment.
Elizabeth was
prepared to see
him in his
glory; and she
could not help
fancying that
in displaying
the good
proportion of
the room, its
aspect, and its
furniture, he
addressed
himself
particularly to
her, as if
wishing to make
her feel what
she had lost in
refusing him.
But though
everything
seemed neat and
comfortable,
she was not
able to gratify
him by any sigh
of repentance;
and rather
looked with
wonder at her
friend, that
she could have
so cheerful an
air with such a
companion. When
Mr. Collins
said anything
of which his
wife might
reasonably be
ashamed, which
certainly was
not seldom, she
involuntarily
turned her eye
on Charlotte.
Once or twice
she could
discern a faint
blush; but in
general
Charlotte
wisely did not
hear. After
sitting long
enough to
admire every
article of
furniture in
the room, from
the sideboard
to the fender,
to give an
account of
their journey,
and of all that
had happened in
London, Mr.
Collins invited
them to take a
stroll in the
garden, which
was large and
well laid out,
and to the
cultivation of
which he
attended
himself. To
work in his
garden was one
of his most
respectable
pleasures; and
Elizabeth
admired the
command of
countenance
with which
Charlotte
talked of the
healthfulness
of the
exercise, and
owned she
encouraged it
as much as
possible. Here,
leading the way
through every
walk and cross
walk, and
scarcely
allowing them
an interval to
utter the
praises he
asked for,
every view was
pointed out
with a
minuteness
which left
beauty entirely
behind. He
could number
the fields in
every
direction, and
could tell how
many trees
there were in
the most
distant clump.
But of all the
views which his
garden, or
which the
country or the
kingdom could
boast, none
were to be
compared with
the prospect of
Rosings,
afforded by an
opening in the
trees that
bordered the
park nearly
opposite the
front of his
house. It was a
handsome modern
building, well
situated on
rising ground.
From his
garden, Mr.
Collins would
have led them
round his two
meadows; but
the ladies, not
having shoes to
encounter the
remains of a
white frost,
turned back;
and while Sir
William
accompanied
him, Charlotte
took her sister
and friend over
the house,
extremely well
pleased,
probably, to
have the
opportunity of
showing it
without her
husband’s help.
It was rather
small, but well
built and
convenient; and
everything was
fitted up and
arranged with a
neatness and
consistency, of
which Elizabeth
gave Charlotte
all the credit.
When Mr.
Collins could
be forgotten,
there was
really a great
air of comfort
throughout, and
by Charlotte’s
evident
enjoyment of
it, Elizabeth
supposed he
must be often
forgotten. She
had already
learnt that
Lady Catherine
was still in
the country. It
was spoken of
again while
they were at
dinner, when
Mr. Collins
joining in,
observed,--
“Yes, Miss
Elizabeth, you
will have the
honour of
seeing Lady
Catherine de
Bourgh on the
ensuing Sunday
at church, and
I need not say
you will be
delighted with
her. She is all
affability and
condescension,
and I doubt not
but you will be
honoured with
some portion of
her notice when
service is
over. I have
scarcely any
hesitation in
saying that she
will include
you and my
sister Maria in
every
invitation with
which she
honours us
during your
stay here. Her
behaviour to my
dear Charlotte
is charming. We
dine at Rosings
twice every
week, and are
never allowed
to walk home.
Her Ladyship’s
carriage is
regularly
ordered for us.
I _should_ say,
one of her
Ladyship’s
carriages, for
she has
several.” “Lady
Catherine is a
very
respectable,
sensible woman,
indeed,” added
Charlotte, “and
a most
attentive
neighbour.”
“Very true, my
dear, that is
exactly what I
say. She is the
sort of woman
whom one cannot
regard with too
much
deference.” The
evening was
spent chiefly
in talking over
Hertfordshire
news, and
telling again
what had been
already
written; and
when it closed,
Elizabeth, in
the solitude of
her chamber,
had to meditate
upon
Charlotte’s
degree of
contentment, to
understand her
address in
guiding, and
composure in
bearing with,
her husband,
and to
acknowledge
that it was all
done very well.
She had also to
anticipate how
her visit would
pass, the quiet
tenour of their
usual
employments,
the vexatious
interruptions
of Mr. Collins,
and the
gaieties of
their
intercourse
with Rosings. A
lively
imagination
soon settled it
all. About the
middle of the
next day, as
she was in her
room getting
ready for a
walk, a sudden
noise below
seemed to speak
the whole house
in confusion;
and, after
listening a
moment, she
heard somebody
running
upstairs in a
violent hurry,
and calling
loudly after
her. She opened
the door, and
met Maria in
the
landing-place,
who, breathless
with agitation,
cried out,-- ]
“Oh, my dear
Eliza! pray
make haste and
come into the
dining-room,
for there is
such a sight to
be seen! I will
not tell you
what it is.
Make haste, and
come down this
moment.”
Elizabeth asked
questions in
vain; Maria
would tell her
nothing more;
and down they
ran into the
dining-room
which fronted
the lane, in
quest of this
wonder; it was
two ladies,
stopping in a
low phaeton at
the garden
gate. “And is
this all?”
cried
Elizabeth. “I
expected at
least that the
pigs were got
into the
garden, and
here is nothing
but Lady
Catherine and
her daughter!”
“La! my dear,”
said Maria,
quite shocked
at the mistake,
“it is not Lady
Catherine. The
old lady is
Mrs. Jenkinson,
who lives with
them. The other
is Miss De
Bourgh. Only
look at her.
She is quite a
little
creature. Who
would have
thought she
could be so
thin and
small!” “She is
abominably rude
to keep
Charlotte out
of doors in all
this wind. Why
does she not
come in?” “Oh,
Charlotte says
she hardly ever
does. It is the
greatest of
favours when
Miss De Bourgh
comes in.” “I
like her
appearance,”
said Elizabeth,
struck with
other ideas.
“She looks
sickly and
cross. Yes, she
will do for him
very well. She
will make him a
very proper
wife.” Mr.
Collins and
Charlotte were
both standing
at the gate in
conversation
with the
ladies; and Sir
William, to
Elizabeth’s
high diversion,
was stationed
in the doorway,
in earnest
contemplation
of the
greatness
before him, and
constantly
bowing whenever
Miss De Bourgh
looked that
way. At length
there was
nothing more to
be said; the
ladies drove
on, and the
others returned
into the house.
Mr. Collins no
sooner saw the
two girls than
he began to
congratulate
them on their
good fortune,
which Charlotte
explained by
letting them
know that the
whole party was
asked to dine
at Rosings the
next day.

=====

Sir William
stayed only a
week at
Hunsford; but
his visit was
long enough to
convince him of
his daughter’s
being most
comfortably
settled, and of
her possessing
such a husband
and such a
neighbour as
were not often
met with. While
Sir William was
with them, Mr.
Collins devoted
his mornings to
driving him out
in his gig, and
showing him the
country: but
when he went
away, the whole
family returned
to their usual
employments,
and Elizabeth
was thankful to
find that they
did not see
more of her
cousin by the
alteration; for
the chief of
the time
between
breakfast and
dinner was now
passed by him
either at work
in the garden,
or in reading
and writing,
and looking out
of window in
his own book
room, which
fronted the
road. The room
in which the
ladies sat was
backwards.
Elizabeth at
first had
rather wondered
that Charlotte
should not
prefer the
dining parlour
for common use;
it was a better
sized room, and
had a
pleasanter
aspect: but she
soon saw that
her friend had
an excellent
reason for what
she did, for
Mr. Collins
would
undoubtedly
have been much
less in his own
apartment had
they sat in one
equally lively;
and she gave
Charlotte
credit for the
arrangement.
From the
drawing-room
they could
distinguish
nothing in the
lane, and were
indebted to Mr.
Collins for the
knowledge of
what carriages
went along, and
how often
especially Miss
De Bourgh drove
by in her
phaeton, which
he never failed
coming to
inform them of,
though it
happened almost
every day. She
not
unfrequently
stopped at the
Parsonage, and
had a few
minutes’
conversation
with Charlotte,
but was
scarcely ever
prevailed on to
get out. Very
few days passed
in which Mr.
Collins did not
walk to
Rosings, and
not many in
which his wife
did not think
it necessary to
go likewise;
and till
Elizabeth
recollected
that there
might be other
family livings
to be disposed
of, she could
not understand
the sacrifice
of so many
hours. Now and
then they were
honoured with a
call from her
Ladyship, and
nothing escaped
her observation
that was
passing in the
room during
these visits.
She examined
into their
employments,
looked at their
work, and
advised them to
do it
differently;
found fault
with the
arrangement of
the furniture,
or detected the
housemaid in
negligence; and
if she accepted
any
refreshment,
seemed to do it
only for the
sake of finding
out that Mrs.
Collins’s
joints of meat
were too large
for her family.
Elizabeth soon
perceived, that
though this
great lady was
not in the
commission of
the peace for
the county, she
was a most
active
magistrate in
her own parish,
the minutest
concerns of
which were
carried to her
by Mr. Collins;
and whenever
any of the
cottagers were
disposed to be
quarrelsome,
discontented,
or too poor,
she sallied
forth into the
village to
settle their
differences,
silence their
complaints, and
scold them into
harmony and
plenty.

=====

The
entertainment
of dining at
Rosings was
repeated about
twice a week;
and, allowing
for the loss of
Sir William,
and there being
only one
card-table in
the evening,
every such
entertainment
was the
counterpart of
the first.
Their other
engagements
were few, as
the style of
living of the
neighbourhood
in general was
beyond the
Collinses’
reach. This,
however, was no
evil to
Elizabeth, and
upon the whole
she spent her
time
comfortably
enough: there
were half hours
of pleasant
conversation
with Charlotte,
and the weather
was so fine for
the time of
year, that she
had often great
enjoyment out
of doors. Her
favourite walk,
and where she
frequently went
while the
others were
calling on Lady
Catherine, was
along the open
grove which
edged that side
of the park,
where there was
a nice
sheltered path,
which no one
seemed to value
but herself,
and where she
felt beyond the
reach of Lady
Catherine’s
curiosity. In
this quiet way
the first
fortnight of
her visit soon
passed away.
Easter was
approaching,
and the week
preceding it
was to bring an
addition to the
family at
Rosings, which
in so small a
circle must be
important.
Elizabeth had
heard, soon
after her
arrival, that
Mr. Darcy was
expected there
in the course
of a few weeks;
and though
there were not
many of her
acquaintance
whom she did
not prefer, his
coming would
furnish one
comparatively
new to look at
in their
Rosings
parties, and
she might be
amused in
seeing how
hopeless Miss
Bingley’s
designs on him
were, by his
behaviour to
his cousin, for
whom he was
evidently
destined by
Lady Catherine,
who talked of
his coming with
the greatest
satisfaction,
spoke of him in
terms of the
highest
admiration, and
seemed almost
angry to find
that he had
already been
frequently seen
by Miss Lucas
and herself.
His arrival was
soon known at
the Parsonage;
for Mr. Collins
was walking the
whole morning
within view of
the lodges
opening into
Hunsford Lane,
in order to
have ] the
earliest
assurance of
it; and, after
making his bow
as the carriage
turned into the
park, hurried
home with the
great
intelligence.
On the
following
morning he
hastened to
Rosings to pay
his respects.
There were two
nephews of Lady
Catherine to
require them,
for Mr. Darcy
had brought
with him a
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
the younger son
of his uncle,
Lord ----; and,
to the great
surprise of all
the party, when
Mr. Collins
returned, the
gentlemen
accompanied
him. Charlotte
had seen them
from her
husband’s room,
crossing the
road, and
immediately
running into
the other, told
the girls what
an honour they
might expect,
adding,-- “I
may thank you,
Eliza, for this
piece of
civility. Mr.
Darcy would
never have come
so soon to wait
upon me.”
Elizabeth had
scarcely time
to disclaim all
right to the
compliment
before their
approach was
announced by
the door-bell,
and shortly
afterwards the
three gentlemen
entered the
room. Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
who led the
way, was about
thirty, not
handsome, but
in person and
address most
truly the
gentleman. Mr.
Darcy looked
just as he had
been used to
look in
Hertfordshire,
paid his
compliments,
with his usual
reserve, to
Mrs. Collins;
and whatever
might be his
feelings
towards her
friend, met her
with every
appearance of
composure.
Elizabeth
merely
courtesied to
him, without
saying a word.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
entered into
conversation
directly, with
the readiness
and ease of a
well-bred man,
and talked very
pleasantly; but
his cousin,
after having
addressed a
slight
observation on
the house and
garden to Mrs.
Collins, sat
for some time
without
speaking to
anybody. At
length,
however, his
civility was so
far awakened as
to inquire of
Elizabeth after
the health of
her family. She
answered him in
the usual way;
and, after a
moment’s pause,
added,-- “My
eldest sister
has been in
town these
three months.
Have you never
happened to see
her there?” She
was perfectly
sensible that
he never had:
but she wished
to see whether
he would betray
any
consciousness
of what had
passed between
the Bingleys
and Jane; and
she thought he
looked a little
confused as he
answered that
he had never
been so
fortunate as to
meet Miss
Bennet. The
subject was
pursued no
further, and
the gentlemen
soon afterwards
went away.

=====

“But,” he
added, “you
will of course
wish to have
your humble
respects
delivered to
them, with your
grateful thanks
for their
kindness to you
while you have
been here.”
Elizabeth made
no objection:
the door was
then allowed to
be shut, and
the carriage
drove off.
“Good
gracious!”
cried Maria,
after a few
minutes’
silence, “it
seems but a day
or two since we
first came! and
yet how many
things have
happened!” “A
great many
indeed,” said
her companion,
with a sigh.
“We have dined
nine times at
Rosings,
besides
drinking tea
there twice!
How much I
shall have to
tell!”
Elizabeth
privately
added, “And how
much I shall
have to
conceal!” Their
journey was
performed
without much
conversation,
or any alarm;
and within four
hours of their
leaving
Hunsford they
reached Mr.
Gardiner’s
house, where
they were to
remain a few
days. Jane
looked well,
and Elizabeth
had little
opportunity of
studying her
spirits, amidst
the various
engagements
which the
kindness of her
aunt had
reserved for
them. But Jane
was to go home
with her, and
at Longbourn
there would be
leisure enough
for
observation. It
was not without
an effort,
meanwhile, that
she could wait
even for
Longbourn,
before she told
her sister of
Mr. Darcy’s
proposals. To
know that she
had the power
of revealing
what would so
exceedingly
astonish Jane,
and must, at
the same time,
so highly
gratify
whatever of her
own vanity she
had not yet
been able to
reason away,
was such a
temptation to
openness as
nothing could
have conquered,
but the state
of indecision
in which she
remained as to
the extent of
what she should
communicate,
and her fear,
if she once
entered on the
subject, of
being hurried
into repeating
something of
Bingley, which
might only
grieve her
sister further.

=====

“I do not
believe that he
will ever live
at Netherfield
any more.” “Oh,
well! it is
just as he
chooses. Nobody
wants him to
come; though I
shall always
say that he
used my
daughter
extremely ill;
and, if I was
her, I would
not have put up
with it. Well,
my comfort is,
I am sure Jane
will die of a
broken heart,
and then he
will be sorry
for what he has
done.” But as
Elizabeth could
not receive
comfort from
any such
expectation she
made no answer.
“Well, Lizzy,”
continued her
mother, soon
afterwards,
“and so the
Collinses live
very
comfortable, do
they? Well,
well, I only
hope it will
last. And what
sort of table
do they keep?
Charlotte is an
excellent
manager, I dare
say. If she is
half as sharp
as her mother,
she is saving
enough. There
is nothing
extravagant in
_their_
housekeeping, I
dare say.” “No,
nothing at
all.” “A great
deal of good
management,
depend upon it.
Yes, yes.
_They_ will
take care not
to outrun their
income. _They_
will never be
distressed for
money. Well,
much good may
it do them! And
so, I suppose,
they often talk
of having
Longbourn when
your father is
dead. They look
upon it quite
as their own, I
dare say,
whenever that
happens.” “It
was a subject
which they
could not
mention before
me.” “No; it
would have been
strange if they
had. But I make
no doubt they
often talk of
it between
themselves.
Well, if they
can be easy
with an estate
that is not
lawfully their
own, so much
the better. _I_
should be
ashamed of
having one that
was only
entailed on
me.”

=====

Elizabeth had
been a good
deal
disappointed in
not finding a
letter from
Jane on their
first arrival
at Lambton; and
this
disappointment
had been
renewed on each
of the mornings
that had now
been spent
there; but on
the third her
repining was
over, and her
sister
justified, by
the receipt of
two letters
from her at
once, on one of
which was
marked that it
had been
mis-sent
elsewhere.
Elizabeth was
not surprised
at it, as Jane
had written the
direction
remarkably ill.
They had just
been preparing
to walk as the
letters came
in; and her
uncle and aunt,
leaving her to
enjoy them in
quiet, set off
by themselves.
The one
mis-sent must
be first
attended to; it
had been
written five
days ago. The
beginning
contained an
account of all
their little
parties and
engagements,
with such news
as the country
afforded; but
the latter
half, which was
dated a day
later, and
written in
evident
agitation, gave
more important
intelligence.
It was to this
effect:--
“Since writing
the above,
dearest Lizzy,
something has
occurred of a
most unexpected
and serious
nature; but I
am afraid of
alarming
you--be assured
that we are all
well. What I
have to say
relates to poor
Lydia. An
express came at
twelve last
night, just as
we were all
gone to bed,
from Colonel
Forster, to
inform us that
she was gone
off to Scotland
with one of his
officers; to
own the truth,
with Wickham!
Imagine our
surprise. To
Kitty, however,
it does not
seem so wholly
unexpected. I
am very, very
sorry. So
imprudent a
match on both
sides! But I am
willing to hope
the best, and
that his
character has
been
misunderstood.
Thoughtless and
indiscreet I
can easily
believe him,
but this step
(and let us
rejoice over
it) marks
nothing bad at
heart. His
choice is
disinterested
at least, for
he must know my
father can give
her nothing.
Our poor mother
is sadly
grieved. My
father bears it
better. How
thankful am I,
that we never
let them know
what has been
said against
him; we must
forget it
ourselves. They
were off
Saturday night
about twelve,
as is
conjectured,
but were not
missed till
yesterday
morning at
eight. The
express was
sent off
directly. My
dear Lizzy,
they must have
passed within
ten miles of
us. Colonel
Forster gives
us reason to
expect him here
soon. Lydia
left a few
lines for his
wife, informing
her of their
intention. I
must conclude,
for I cannot be
long from my
poor mother. I
am afraid you
will not be
able to make it
out, but I
hardly know
what I have
written.”
Without
allowing
herself time
for
consideration,
and scarcely
knowing what
she felt,
Elizabeth, on
finishing this
letter,
instantly
seized the
other, and
opening it with
the utmost
impatience,
read as
follows: it had
been written a
day later than
the conclusion
of the first.
“By this time,
my dearest
sister, you
have received
my hurried
letter; I wish
this may be
more
intelligible,
but though not
confined for
time, my head
is so
bewildered that
I cannot answer
for being
coherent.
Dearest Lizzy,
I hardly know
what I would
write, but I
have bad news
for you, and it
cannot be
delayed.
Imprudent as a
marriage
between Mr.
Wickham and our
poor Lydia
would be, we
are now anxious
to be assured
it has taken
place, for
there is but
too much reason
to fear they
are not gone to
Scotland.
Colonel Forster
came yesterday,
having left
Brighton the
day before, not
many hours
after the
express. Though
Lydia’s short
letter to Mrs.
F. gave them to
understand that
they were going
to Gretna
Green,
something was
dropped by
Denny
expressing his
belief that W.
never intended
to go there, or
to marry Lydia
at all, which
was repeated to
Colonel F.,
who, instantly
taking the
alarm, set off
from B.,
intending to
trace their
route. He did
trace them
easily to
Clapham, but no
farther; for on
entering that
place, they
removed into a
hackney-coach,
and dismissed
the chaise that
brought them
from Epsom. All
that is known
after this is,
that they were
seen to
continue the
London road. I
know not what
to think. After
making every
possible
inquiry on that
side of London,
Colonel F. came
on into
Hertfordshire,
anxiously
renewing them
at all the
turnpikes, and
at the inns in
Barnet and
Hatfield, but
without any
success,--no
such people had
been seen to
pass through.
With the
kindest concern
he came on to
Longbourn, and
broke his
apprehensions
to us in a
manner most
creditable to
his heart. I am
sincerely
grieved for him
and Mrs. F.;
but no one can
throw any blame
on them. Our
distress, my
dear Lizzy, is
very great. My
father and
mother believe
the worst, but
I cannot think
so ill of him.
Many
circumstances
might make it
more eligible
for them to be
married
privately in
town than to
pursue their
first plan; and
even if _he_
could form such
a design
against a young
woman of
Lydia’s
connections,
which is not
likely, can I
suppose her so
lost to
everything?
Impossible! I
grieve to find,
however, that
Colonel F. is
not disposed to
depend upon
their marriage:
he shook his
head when I
expressed my
hopes, and said
he feared W.
was not a man
to be trusted.
My poor mother
is really ill,
and keeps her
room. Could she
exert herself,
it would be
better, but
this is not to
be expected;
and as to my
father, I never
in my life saw
him so
affected. Poor
Kitty has anger
for having
concealed their
attachment; but
as it was a
matter of
confidence, one
cannot wonder.
I am truly
glad, dearest
Lizzy, that you
have been
spared
something of
these
distressing
scenes; but
now, as the
first shock is
over, shall I
own that I long
for your
return? I am
not so selfish,
however, as to
press for it,
if
inconvenient.
Adieu! I take
up my pen again
to do, what I
have just told
you I would
not; but
circumstances
are such, that
I cannot help
earnestly
begging you all
to come here as
soon as
possible. I
know my dear
uncle and aunt
so well, that I
am not afraid
of requesting
it, though I
have still
something more
to ask of the
former. My
father is going
to London with
Colonel Forster
instantly, to
try to discover
her. What he
means to do, I
am sure I know
not; but his
excessive
distress will
not allow him
to pursue any
measure in the
best and safest
way, and
Colonel Forster
is obliged to
be at Brighton
again to-morrow
evening. In
such an
exigence my
uncle’s advice
and assistance
would be
everything in
the world; he
will
immediately
comprehend what
I must feel,
and I rely upon
his goodness.”
“Oh! where,
where is my
uncle?” cried
Elizabeth,
darting from
her seat as she
finished the
letter, in
eagerness to
follow him,
without losing
a moment of the
time so
precious; but
as she reached
the door, it
was opened by a
servant, and
Mr. Darcy
appeared. Her
pale face and
impetuous
manner made him
start, and
before he could
recover himself
enough to
speak, she, in
whose mind
every idea was
superseded by
Lydia’s
situation,
hastily
exclaimed, “I
beg your
pardon, but I
must leave you.
I must find Mr.
Gardiner this
moment on
business that
cannot be
delayed; I have
not an instant
to lose.” “Good
God! what is
the matter?”
cried he, with
more feeling
than
politeness;
then
recollecting
himself, “I
will not detain
you a minute;
but let me, or
let the
servant, go
after Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner.
You are not
well enough;
you cannot go
yourself.”
Elizabeth
hesitated; but
her knees
trembled under
her, and she
felt how little
would be gained
by her
attempting to
pursue them.
Calling back
the servant,
therefore, she
commissioned
him, though in
so breathless
an accent as
made her almost
unintelligible,
to fetch his
master and
mistress home
instantly. On
his quitting
the room, she
sat down,
unable to
support
herself, and
looking so
miserably ill,
that it was
impossible for
Darcy to leave
her, or to
refrain from
saying, in a
tone of
gentleness and
commiseration,
“Let me call
your maid. Is
there nothing
you could take
to give you
present relief?
A glass of
wine; shall I
get you one?
You are very
ill.” “No, I
thank you,” she
replied,
endeavouring to
recover
herself. “There
is nothing the
matter with me.
I am quite
well, I am only
distressed by
some dreadful
news which I
have just
received from
Longbourn.” She
burst into
tears as she
alluded to it,
and for a few
minutes could
not speak
another word.
Darcy, in
wretched
suspense, could
only say
something
indistinctly of
his

“Oh,
thoughtless,
thoughtless
Lydia!” cried
Elizabeth when
she had
finished it.
“What a letter
is this, to be
written at such
a moment! But
at least it
shows that
_she_ was
serious in the
object of her
journey.
Whatever he
might
afterwards
persuade her
to, it was not
on her side a
_scheme_ of
infamy. My poor
father! how he
must have felt
it!” “I never
saw anyone so
shocked. He
could not speak
a word for full
ten minutes. My
mother was
taken ill
immediately,
and the whole
house in such
confusion!”
“Oh, Jane,”
cried
Elizabeth, “was
there a servant
belonging to it
who did not
know the whole
story before
the end of the
day?” “I do not
know: I hope
there was. But
to be guarded
at such a time
is very
difficult. My
mother was in
hysterics; and
though I
endeavoured to
give her every
assistance in
my power, I am
afraid I did
not do so much
as I might have
done. But the
horror of what
might possibly
happen almost
took from me my
faculties.”
“Your
attendance upon
her has been
too much for
you. You do not
look well. Oh
that I had been
with you! you
have had every
care and
anxiety upon
yourself
alone.” “Mary
and Kitty have
been very kind,
and would have
shared in every
fatigue, I am
sure, but I did
not think it
right for
either of them.
Kitty is slight
and delicate,
and Mary
studies so much
that her hours
of repose
should not be
broken in on.
My aunt Philips
came to
Longbourn on
Tuesday, after
my father went
away; and was
so good as to
stay till
Thursday with
me. She was of
great use and
comfort to us
all, and Lady
Lucas has been
very kind: she
walked here on
Wednesday
morning to
condole with
us, and offered
her services,
or any of her
daughters, if
they could be
of use to us.”
“She had better
have stayed at
home,” cried
Elizabeth:
“perhaps she
_meant_ well,
but, under such
a misfortune as
this, one
cannot see too
little of one’s
neighbours.
Assistance is
impossible;
condolence,
insufferable.
Let them
triumph over us
at a distance,
and be
satisfied.” She
then proceeded
to inquire into
the measures
which her
father had
intended to
pursue, while
in town, for
the recovery of
his daughter.
“He meant, I
believe,”
replied Jane,
“to go to
Epsom, the
place where
they last
changed horses,
see the
postilions, and
try if anything
could be made
out from them.
His principal
object must be
to discover the
number of the
hackney coach
which took them
from Clapham.
It had come
with a fare
from London;
and as he
thought the
circumstance of
a gentleman and
lady’s removing
from one
carriage into
another might
be remarked, he
meant to make
inquiries at
Clapham. If he
could anyhow
discover at
what house the
coachman had
before set down
his fare, he
determined to
make inquiries
there, and
hoped it might
not be
impossible to
find out the
stand and
number of the
coach. I do not
know of any
other designs
that he had
formed; but he
was in such a
hurry to be
gone, and his
spirits so
greatly
discomposed,
that I had
difficulty in
finding out
even so much as
this.”

=====

Two days after
Mr. Bennet’s
return, as Jane
and Elizabeth
were walking
together in the
shrubbery
behind the
house, they saw
the housekeeper
coming towards
them, and
concluding that
she came to
call them to
their mother,
went forward to
meet her; but
instead of the
expected
summons, when
they approached
her, she said
to Miss Bennet,
“I beg your
pardon, madam,
for
interrupting
you, but I was
in hopes you
might have got
some good news
from town, so I
took the
liberty of
coming to ask.”
“What do you
mean, Hill? We
have heard
nothing from
town.” “Dear
madam,” cried
Mrs. Hill, in
great
astonishment,
“don’t you know
there is an
express come
for master from
Mr. Gardiner?
He has been
here this half
hour, and
master has had
a letter.” Away
ran the girls,
too eager to
get in to have
time for
speech. They
ran through the
vestibule into
the
breakfast-room;
from thence to
the
library;--their
father was in
neither; and
they were on
the point of
seeking him
upstairs with
their mother,
when they were
met by the
butler, who
said,-- “If you
are looking for
my master,
ma’am, he is
walking towards
the little
copse.” Upon
this
information,
they instantly
passed through
the hall once
more, and ran
across the lawn
after their
father, who was
deliberately
pursuing his
way towards a
small wood on
one side of the
paddock. Jane,
who was not so
light, nor so
much in the
habit of
running as
Elizabeth, soon
lagged behind,
while her
sister, panting
for breath,
came up with
him, and
eagerly cried
out,-- “Oh,
papa, what
news? what
news? have you
heard from my
uncle?” “Yes, I
have had a
letter from him
by express.”
“Well, and what
news does it
bring--good or
bad?” “What is
there of good
to be
expected?” said
he, taking the
letter from his
pocket; “but
perhaps you
would like to
read it.”
Elizabeth
impatiently
caught it from
his hand. Jane
now came up.
“Read it
aloud,” said
their father,
“for I hardly
know myself
what it is
about.” /*
RIGHT
“Gracechurch
Street,
_Monday, August
2_. */ “My dear
Brother, “At
last I am able
to send you
some tidings of
my niece, and
such as, upon
the whole, I
hope will give
you
satisfaction.
Soon after you
left me on
Saturday, I was
fortunate
enough to find
out in what
part of London
they were. The
particulars I
reserve till we
meet. It is
enough to know
they are
discovered: I
have seen them
both----” ]
“Then it is as
I always
hoped,” cried
Jane: “they are
married!”
Elizabeth read
on: “I have
seen them both.
They are not
married, nor
can I find
there was any
intention of
being so; but
if you are
willing to
perform the
engagements
which I have
ventured to
make on your
side, I hope it
will not be
long before
they are. All
that is
required of you
is, to assure
to your
daughter, by
settlement, her
equal share of
the five
thousand
pounds, secured
among your
children after
the decease of
yourself and my
sister; and,
moreover, to
enter into an
engagement of
allowing her,
during your
life, one
hundred pounds
per annum.
These are
conditions
which,
considering
everything, I
had no
hesitation in
complying with,
as far as I
thought myself
privileged, for
you. I shall
send this by
express, that
no time may be
lost in
bringing me
your answer.
You will easily
comprehend,
from these
particulars,
that Mr.
Wickham’s
circumstances
are not so
hopeless as
they are
generally
believed to be.
The world has
been deceived
in that
respect; and I
am happy to
say, there will
be some little
money, even
when all his
debts are
discharged, to
settle on my
niece, in
addition to her
own fortune.
If, as I
conclude will
be the case,
you send me
full powers to
act in your
name throughout
the whole of
this business,
I will
immediately
give directions
to Haggerston
for preparing a
proper
settlement.
There will not
be the smallest
occasion for
your coming to
town again;
therefore stay
quietly at
Longbourn, and
depend on my
diligence and
care. Send back
your answer as
soon as you
can, and be
careful to
write
explicitly. We
have judged it
best that my
niece should be
married from
this house, of
which I hope
you will
approve. She
comes to us
to-day. I shall
write again as
soon as
anything more
is determined
on. Yours, etc.
“EDW.
GARDINER.” “Is
it possible?”
cried
Elizabeth, when
she had
finished. “Can
it be possible
that he will
marry her?”
“Wickham is not
so undeserving,
then, as we
have thought
him,” said her
sister. “My
dear father, I
congratulate
you.” “And have
you answered
the letter?”
said Elizabeth.
“No; but it
must be done
soon.” Most
earnestly did
she then
entreat him to
lose no more
time before he
wrote. “Oh! my
dear father,”
she cried,
“come back and
write
immediately.
Consider how
important every
moment is in
such a case.”
“Let me write
for you,” said
Jane, “if you
dislike the
trouble
yourself.” “I
dislike it very
much,” he
replied; “but
it must be
done.” And so
saying, he
turned back
with them, and
walked towards
the house.
“And--may I
ask?” said
Elizabeth; “but
the terms, I
suppose, must
be complied
with.”
“Complied with!
I am only
ashamed of his
asking so
little.” “And
they _must_
marry! Yet he
is _such_ a
man.” “Yes,
yes, they must
marry. There is
nothing else to
be done. But
there are two
things that I
want very much
to know:--one
is, how much
money your
uncle has laid
down to bring
it about; and
the other, how
I am ever to
pay him.”
“Money! my
uncle!” cried
Jane, “what do
you mean, sir?”
“I mean that no
man in his
proper senses
would marry
Lydia on so
slight a
temptation as
one hundred a
year during my
life, and fifty
after I am
gone.” “That is
very true,”
said Elizabeth;
“though it had
not occurred to
me before. His
debts to be
discharged, and
something still
to remain! Oh,
it must be my
uncle’s doings!
Generous, good
man, I am
afraid he has
distressed
himself. A
small sum could
not do all
this.” “No,”
said her
father.
“Wickham’s a
fool if he
takes her with
a farthing less
than ten
thousand
pounds: I
should be sorry
to think so ill
of him, in the
very beginning
of our
relationship.”
“Ten thousand
pounds! Heaven
forbid! How is
half such a sum
to be repaid?”
Mr. Bennet made
no answer; and
each of them,
deep in
thought,
continued
silent till
they reached
the house.
Their father
then went to
the library to
write, and the
girls walked
into the
breakfast-room.
“And they are
really to be
married!” cried
Elizabeth, as
soon as they
were by
themselves.
“How strange
this is! and
for _this_ we
are to be
thankful. That
they should
marry, small as
is their chance
of happiness,
and wretched as
is his
character, we
are forced to
rejoice! Oh,
Lydia!” “I
comfort myself
with thinking,”
replied Jane,
“that he
certainly would
not marry
Lydia, if he
had not a real
regard for her.
Though our kind
uncle has done
something
towards
clearing him, I
cannot believe
that ten
thousand
pounds, or
anything like
it, has been
advanced. He
has children of
his own, and
may have more.
How could he
spare half ten
thousand
pounds?” “If we
are ever able
to learn what
Wickham’s debts
have been,”
said Elizabeth,
“and how much
is settled on
his side on our
sister, we
shall exactly
know what Mr.
Gardiner has
done for them,
because Wickham
has not
sixpence of his
own. The
kindness of my
uncle and aunt
can never be
requited. Their
taking her
home, and
affording her
their personal
protection and
countenance, is
such a
sacrifice to
her advantage
as years of
gratitude
cannot enough
acknowledge. By
this time she
is actually
with them! If
such goodness
does not make
her miserable
now, she will
never deserve
to be happy!
What a meeting
for her, when
she first sees
my aunt!” “We
must endeavour
to forget all
that has passed
on either
side,” said
Jane: “I hope
and trust they
will yet be
happy. His
consenting to
marry her is a
proof, I will
believe, that
he is come to a
right way of
thinking. Their
mutual
affection will
steady them;
and I flatter
myself they
will settle so
quietly, and
live in so
rational a
manner, as may
in time make
their past
imprudence
forgotten.”
“Their conduct
has been such,”
replied
Elizabeth, “as
neither you,
nor I, nor
anybody, can
ever forget. It
is useless to
talk of it.” It
now occurred to
the girls that
their mother
was in all
likelihood
perfectly
ignorant of
what had
happened. They
went to the
library,
therefore, and
asked their
father whether
he would not
wish them to
make it known
to her. He was
writing, and,
without raising
his head,
coolly
replied,--
“Just as you
please.” “May
we take my
uncle’s letter
to read to
her?” “Take
whatever you
like, and get
away.”
Elizabeth took
the letter from
his
writing-table,
and they went
upstairs
together. Mary
and Kitty were
both with Mrs.
Bennet: one
communication
would,
therefore, do
for all. After
a slight
preparation for
good news, the
letter was read
aloud. Mrs.
Bennet could
hardly contain
herself. As
soon as Jane
had read Mr.
Gardiner’s hope
of Lydia’s
being soon
married, her
joy burst
forth, and
every following
sentence added
to its
exuberance. She
was now in an
irritation as
violent from
delight as she
had ever been
fidgety from
alarm and
vexation. To
know that her
daughter would
be married was
enough. She was
disturbed by no
fear for her
felicity, nor
humbled by any
remembrance of
her misconduct.
“My dear, dear
Lydia!” she
cried: “this is
delightful
indeed! She
will be
married! I
shall see her
again! She will
be married at
sixteen! My
good, kind
brother! I knew
how it would
be--I knew he
would manage
everything. How
I long to see
her! and to see
dear Wickham
too! But the
clothes, the
wedding
clothes! I will
write to my
sister Gardiner
about them
directly.
Lizzy, my dear,
run down to
your father,
and ask him how
much he will
give her. Stay,
stay, I will go
myself. Ring
the bell,
Kitty, for
Hill. I will
put on my
things in a
moment. My
dear, dear
Lydia! How
merry we shall
be together
when we meet!”
Her eldest
daughter
endeavoured to
give some
relief to the
violence of
these
transports, by
leading her
thoughts to the
obligations
which Mr.
Gardiner’s
behaviour laid
them all under.
“For we must
attribute this
happy
conclusion,”
she added, “in
a great measure
to his
kindness. We
are persuaded
that he has
pledged himself
to assist Mr.
Wickham with
money.” “Well,”
cried her
mother, “it is
all very right;
who should do
it but her own
uncle? If he
had not had a
family of his
own, I and my
children must
have had all
his money, you
know; and it is
the first time
we have ever
had anything
from him except
a few presents.
Well! I am so
happy. In a
short time, I
shall have a
daughter
married. Mrs.
Wickham! How
well it sounds!
And she was
only sixteen
last June. My
dear Jane, I am
in such a
flutter, that I
am sure I can’t
write; so I
will dictate,
and you write
for me. We will
settle with
your father
about the money
afterwards; but
the things
should be
ordered
immediately.”
She was then
proceeding to
all the
particulars of
calico, muslin,
and cambric,
and would
shortly have
dictated some
very plentiful
orders, had not
Jane, though
with some
difficulty,
persuaded her
to wait till
her father was
at leisure to
be consulted.
One day’s
delay, she
observed, would
be of small
importance; and
her mother was
too happy to be
quite so
obstinate as
usual. Other
schemes, too,
came into her
head. “I will
go to Meryton,”
said she, “as
soon as I am
dressed, and
tell the good,
good news to my
sister Philips.
And as I come
back, I can
call on Lady
Lucas and Mrs.
Long. Kitty,
run down and
order the
carriage. An
airing would do
me a great deal
of good, I am
sure. Girls,
can I do
anything for
you in Meryton?
Oh! here comes
Hill. My dear
Hill, have you
heard the good
news? Miss
Lydia is going
to be married;
and you shall
all have a bowl
of punch to
make merry at
her wedding.”
Mrs. Hill began
instantly to
express her
joy. Elizabeth
received her
congratulations
amongst the
rest, and then,
sick of this
folly, took
refuge in her
own room, that
she might think
with freedom.
Poor Lydia’s
situation must,
at best, be bad
enough; but
that it was no
worse, she had
need to be
thankful. She
felt it so; and
though, in
looking
forward,
neither
rational
happiness, nor
worldly
prosperity
could be justly
expected for
her sister, in
looking back to
what they had
feared, only
two hours ago,
she felt all
the advantages
of what they
had gained.

=====

Mr. Bennet had
very often
wished, before
this period of
his life, that,
instead of
spending his
whole income,
he had laid by
an annual sum,
for the better
provision of
his children,
and of his
wife, if she
survived him.
He now wished
it more than
ever. Had he
done his duty
in that
respect, Lydia
need not have
been indebted
to her uncle
for whatever of
honour or
credit could
now be
purchased for
her. The
satisfaction of
prevailing on
one of the most
worthless young
men in Great
Britain to be
her husband
might then have
rested in its
proper place.
He was
seriously
concerned that
a cause of so
little
advantage to
anyone should
be forwarded at
the sole
expense of his
brother-in-law;
and he was
determined, if
possible, to
find out the
extent of his
assistance, and
to discharge
the obligation
as soon as he
could. When
first Mr.
Bennet had
married,
economy was
held to be
perfectly
useless; for,
of course, they
were to have a
son. This son
was to join in
cutting off the
entail, as soon
as he should be
of age, and the
widow and
younger
children would
by that means
be provided
for. Five
daughters
successively
entered the
world, but yet
the son was to
come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for
many years
after Lydia’s
birth, had been
certain that he
would. This
event had at
last been
despaired of,
but it was then
too late to be
saving. Mrs.
Bennet had no
turn for
economy; and
her husband’s
love of
independence
had alone
prevented their
exceeding their
income. Five
thousand pounds
was settled by
marriage
articles on
Mrs. Bennet and
the children.
But in what
proportions it
should be
divided amongst
the latter
depended on the
will of the
parents. This
was one point,
with regard to
Lydia at least,
which was now
to be settled,
and Mr. Bennet
could have no
hesitation in
acceding to the
proposal before
him. In terms
of grateful
acknowledgment
for the
kindness of his
brother, though
expressed most
concisely, he
then delivered
on paper his
perfect
approbation of
all that was
done, and his
willingness to
fulfil the
engagements
that had been
made for him.
He had never
before supposed
that, could
Wickham be
prevailed on to
marry his
daughter, it
would be done
with so little
inconvenience
to himself as
by the present
arrangement. He
would scarcely
be ten pounds a
year the loser,
by the hundred
that was to be
paid them; for,
what with her
board and
pocket
allowance, and
the continual
presents in
money which
passed to her
through her
mother’s hands,
Lydia’s
expenses had
been very
little within
that sum. That
it would be
done with such
trifling
exertion on his
side, too, was
another very
welcome
surprise; for
his chief wish
at present was
to have as
little trouble
in the business
as possible.
When the first
transports of
rage which had
produced his
activity in
seeking her
were over, he
naturally
returned to all
his former
indolence. His
letter was soon
despatched; for
though dilatory
in undertaking
business, he
was quick in
its execution.
He begged to
know further
particulars of
what he was
indebted to his
brother; but
was too angry
with Lydia to
send any
message to her.
The good news
quickly spread
through the
house; and with
proportionate
speed through
the
neighbourhood.
It was borne in
the latter with
decent
philosophy. To
be sure, it
would have been
more for the
advantage of
conversation,
had Miss Lydia
Bennet come
upon the town;
or, as the
happiest
alternative,
been secluded
from the world
in some distant
farm-house. But
there was much
to be talked
of, in marrying
her; and the
good-natured
wishes for her
well-doing,
which had
proceeded
before from all
the spiteful
old ladies in
Meryton, lost
but little of
their spirit in
this change of
circumstances,
because with
such a husband
her misery was
considered
certain. It was
a fortnight
since Mrs.
Bennet had been
down stairs,
but on this
happy day she
again took her
seat at the
head of her
table, and in
spirits
oppressively
high. No
sentiment of
shame gave a
damp to her
triumph. The
marriage of a
daughter, which
had been the
first object of
her wishes
since Jane was
sixteen, was
now on the
point of
accomplishment,
and her
thoughts and
her words ran
wholly on those
attendants of
elegant
nuptials, fine
muslins, new
carriages, and
servants. She
was busily
searching
through the
neighbourhood
for a proper
situation for
her daughter;
and, without
knowing or
considering
what their
income might
be, rejected
many as
deficient in
size and
importance.
“Haye Park
might do,” said
she, “if the
Gouldings would
quit it, or the
great house at
Stoke, if the
drawing-room
were larger;
but Ashworth is
too far off. I
could not bear
to have her ten
miles from me;
and as for
Purvis Lodge,
the attics are
dreadful.” Her
husband allowed
her to talk on
without
interruption
while the
servants
remained. But
when they had
withdrawn, he
said to her,
“Mrs. Bennet,
before you take
any, or all of
these houses,
for your son
and daughter,
let us come to
a right
understanding.
Into _one_
house in this
neighbourhood
they shall
never have
admittance. I
will not
encourage the
imprudence of
either, by
receiving them
at Longbourn.”
A long dispute
followed this
declaration;
but Mr. Bennet
was firm: it
soon led to
another; and
Mrs. Bennet
found, with
amazement and
horror, that
her husband
would not
advance a
guinea to buy
clothes for his
daughter. He
protested that
she should
receive from
him no mark of
affection
whatever on the
occasion. Mrs.
Bennet could
hardly
comprehend it.
That his anger
could be
carried to such
a point of
inconceivable
resentment as
to refuse his
daughter a
privilege,
without which
her marriage
would scarcely
seem valid,
exceeded all
that she could
believe
possible. She
was more alive
to the
disgrace, which
her want of new
clothes must
reflect on her
daughter’s
nuptials, than
to any sense of
shame at her
eloping and
living with
Wickham a
fortnight
before they
took place.
Elizabeth was
now most
heartily sorry
that she had,
from the
distress of the
moment, been
led to make Mr.
Darcy
acquainted with
their fears for
her sister; for
since her
marriage would
so shortly give
the proper
termination to
the elopement,
they might hope
to conceal its
unfavourable
beginning from
all those who
were not
immediately on
the spot. She
had no fear of
its spreading
farther,
through his
means. There
were few people
on whose
secrecy she
would have more
confidently
depended; but
at the same
time there was
no one whose
knowledge of a
sister’s
frailty would
have mortified
her so much.
Not, however,
from any fear
of disadvantage
from it
individually to
herself; for at
any rate there
seemed a gulf
impassable
between them.
Had Lydia’s
marriage been
concluded on
the most
honourable
terms, it was
not to be
supposed that
Mr. Darcy would
connect himself
with a family,
where to every
other objection
would now be
added an
alliance and
relationship of
the nearest
kind with the
man whom he so
justly scorned.
From such a
connection she
could not
wonder that he
should shrink.
The wish of
procuring her
regard, which
she had assured
herself of his
feeling in
Derbyshire,
could not in
rational
expectation
survive such a
blow as this.
She was
humbled, she
was grieved;
she repented,
though she
hardly knew of
what. She
became jealous
of his esteem,
when she could
no longer hope
to be benefited
by it. She
wanted to hear
of him, when
there seemed
the least
chance of
gaining
intelligence.
She was
convinced that
she could have
been happy with
him, when it
was no longer
likely they
should meet.
What a triumph
for him, as she
often thought,
could he know
that the
proposals which
she had proudly
spurned only
four months ago
would now have
been gladly and
gratefully
received! He
was as
generous, she
doubted not, as
the most
generous of his
sex. But while
he was mortal,
there must be a
triumph. She
began now to
comprehend that
he was exactly
the man who, in
disposition and
talents, would
most suit her.
His
understanding
and temper,
though unlike
her own, would
have answered
all her wishes.
It was an union
that must have
been to the
advantage of
both: by her
ease and
liveliness, his
mind might have
been softened,
his manners
improved; and
from his
judgment,
information,
and knowledge
of the world,
she must have
received
benefit of
greater
importance. But
no such happy
marriage could
now teach the
admiring
multitude what
connubial
felicity really
was. An union
of a different
tendency, and
precluding the
possibility of
the other, was
soon to be
formed in their
family. How
Wickham and
Lydia were to
be supported in
tolerable
independence
she could not
imagine. But
how little of
permanent
happiness could
belong to a
couple who were
only brought
together
because their
passions were
stronger than
their virtue,
she could
easily
conjecture. Mr.
Gardiner soon
wrote again to
his brother. To
Mr. Bennet’s
acknowledgments
he briefly
replied, with
assurances of
his eagerness
to promote the
welfare of any
of his family;
and concluded
with entreaties
that the
subject might
never be
mentioned to
him again. The
principal
purport of his
letter was to
inform them,
that Mr.
Wickham had
resolved on
quitting the
militia. “It
was greatly my
wish that he
should do so,”
he added, “as
soon as his
marriage was
fixed on. And I
think you will
agree with me,
in considering
a removal from
that corps as
highly
advisable, both
on his account
and my niece’s.
It is Mr.
Wickham’s
intention to go
into the
Regulars; and,
among his
former friends,
there are still
some who are
able and
willing to
assist him in
the army. He
has the promise
of an ensigncy
in
General----’s
regiment, now
quartered in
the north. It
is an advantage
to have it so
far from this
part of the
kingdom. He
promises
fairly; and I
hope among
different
people, where
they may each
have a
character to
preserve, they
will both be
more prudent. I
have written to
Colonel
Forster, to
inform him of
our present
arrangements,
and to request
that he will
satisfy the
various
creditors of
Mr. Wickham in
and near
Brighton with
assurances of
speedy payment,
for which I
have pledged
myself. And
will you give
yourself the
trouble of
carrying
similar
assurances to
his creditors
in Meryton, of
whom I shall
subjoin a list,
according to
his
information? He
has given in
all his debts;
I hope at least
he has not
deceived us.
Haggerston has
our directions,
and all will be
completed in a
week. They will
then join his
regiment,
unless they are
first invited
to Longbourn;
and I
understand from
Mrs. Gardiner
that my niece
is very
desirous of
seeing you all
before she
leaves the
south. She is
well, and begs
to be dutifully
remembered to
you and her
mother.--Yours,
etc. “E.
GARDINER.” Mr.
Bennet and his
daughters saw
all the
advantages of
Wickham’s
removal from
the ----shire,
as clearly as
Mr. Gardiner
could do. But
Mrs. Bennet was
not so well
pleased with
it. Lydia’s
being settled
in the north,
just when she
had expected
most pleasure
and pride in
her company,
for she had by
no means given
up her plan of
their residing
in
Hertfordshire,
was a severe
disappointment;
and, besides,
it was such a
pity that Lydia
should be taken
from a regiment
where she was
acquainted with
everybody, and
had so many
favourites.
“She is so fond
of Mrs.
Forster,” said
she, “it will
be quite
shocking to
send her away!
And there are
several of the
young men, too,
that she likes
very much. The
officers may
not be so
pleasant in
General----’s
regiment.” His
daughter’s
request, for
such it might
be considered,
of being
admitted into
her family
again, before
she set off for
the north,
received at
first an
absolute
negative. But
Jane and
Elizabeth, who
agreed in
wishing, for
the sake of
their sister’s
feelings and
consequence,
that she should
be noticed on
her marriage by
her parents,
urged him so
earnestly, yet
so rationally
and so mildly,
to receive her
and her husband
at Longbourn,
as soon as they
were married,
that he was
prevailed on to
think as they
thought, and
act as they
wished. And
their mother
had the
satisfaction of
knowing, that
she should be
able to show
her married
daughter in the
neighbourhood,
before she was
banished to the
north. When Mr.
Bennet wrote
again to his
brother,
therefore, he
sent his
permission for
them to come;
and it was
settled, that,
as soon as the
ceremony was
over, they
should proceed
to Longbourn.
Elizabeth was
surprised,
however, that
Wickham should
consent to such
a scheme; and,
had she
consulted only
her own
inclination,
any meeting
with him would
have been the
last object of
her wishes.

=====

Elizabeth had
the
satisfaction of
receiving an
answer to her
letter as soon
as she possibly
could. She was
no sooner in
possession of
it, than
hurrying into
the little
copse, where
she was least
likely to be
interrupted,
she sat down on
one of the
benches, and
prepared to be
happy; for the
length of the
letter
convinced her
that it did not
contain a
denial. /*
RIGHT
“Gracechurch
Street, _Sept.
6_. */ “My dear
Niece, “I have
just received
your letter,
and shall
devote this
whole morning
to answering
it, as I
foresee that a
_little_
writing will
not comprise
what I have to
tell you. I
must confess
myself
surprised by
your
application; I
did not expect
it from _you_.
Don’t think me
angry, however,
for I only mean
to let you
know, that I
had not
imagined such
inquiries to be
necessary on
_your_ side. If
you do not
choose to
understand me,
forgive my
impertinence.
Your uncle is
as much
surprised as I
am; and nothing
but the belief
of your being a
party concerned
would have
allowed him to
act as he has
done. But if
you are really
innocent and
ignorant, I
must be more
explicit. On
the very day of
my coming home
from Longbourn,
your uncle had
a most
unexpected
visitor. Mr.
Darcy called,
and was shut up
with him
several hours.
It was all over
before I
arrived; so my
curiosity was
not so
dreadfully
racked as
_yours_ seems
to have been.
He came to tell
Mr. Gardiner
that he had
found out where
your sister and
Mr. Wickham
were, and that
he had seen and
talked with
them
both--Wickham
repeatedly,
Lydia once.
From what I can
collect, he
left Derbyshire
only one day
after
ourselves, and
came to town
with the
resolution of
hunting for
them. The
motive
professed was
his conviction
of its being
owing to
himself that
Wickham’s
worthlessness
had not been so
well known as
to make it
impossible for
any young woman
of character to
love or confide
in him. He
generously
imputed the
whole to his
mistaken pride,
and confessed
that he had
before thought
it beneath him
to lay his
private actions
open to the
world. His
character was
to speak for
itself. He
called it,
therefore, his
duty to step
forward, and
endeavour to
remedy an evil
which had been
brought on by
himself. If he
_had another_
motive, I am
sure it would
never disgrace
him. He had
been some days
in town before
he was able to
discover them;
but he had
something to
direct his
search, which
was more than
_we_ had; and
the
consciousness
of this was
another reason
for his
resolving to
follow us.
There is a
lady, it seems,
a Mrs. Younge,
who was some
time ago
governess to
Miss Darcy, and
was dismissed
from her charge
on some cause
of
disapprobation,
though he did
not say what.
She then took a
large house in
Edward Street,
and has since
maintained
herself by
letting
lodgings. This
Mrs. Younge
was, he knew,
intimately
acquainted with
Wickham; and he
went to her for
intelligence of
him, as soon as
he got to town.
But it was two
or three days
before he could
get from her
what he wanted.
She would not
betray her
trust, I
suppose,
without bribery
and corruption,
for she really
did know where
her friend was
to be found.
Wickham,
indeed, had
gone to her on
their first
arrival in
London; and had
she been able
to receive them
into her house,
they would have
taken up their
abode with her.
At length,
however, our
kind friend
procured the
wished-for
direction. They
were in ----
Street. He saw
Wickham, and
afterwards
insisted on
seeing Lydia.
His first
object with
her, he
acknowledged,
had been to
persuade her to
quit her
present
disgraceful
situation, and
return to her
friends as soon
as they could
be prevailed on
to receive her,
offering his
assistance as
far as it would
go. But he
found Lydia
absolutely
resolved on
remaining where
she was. She
cared for none
of her friends;
she wanted no
help of his;
she would not
hear of leaving
Wickham. She
was sure they
should be
married some
time or other,
and it did not
much signify
when. Since
such were her
feelings, it
only remained,
he thought, to
secure and
expedite a
marriage,
which, in his
very first
conversation
with Wickham,
he easily
learnt had
never been
_his_ design.
He confessed
himself obliged
to leave the
regiment on
account of some
debts of honour
which were very
pressing; and
scrupled not to
lay all the ill
consequences of
Lydia’s flight
on her own
folly alone. He
meant to resign
his commission
immediately;
and as to his
future
situation, he
could
conjecture very
little about
it. He must go
somewhere, but
he did not know
where, and he
knew he should
have nothing to
live on. Mr.
Darcy asked why
he did not
marry your
sister at once.
Though Mr.
Bennet was not
imagined to be
very rich, he
would have been
able to do
something for
him, and his
situation must
have been
benefited by
marriage. But
he found, in
reply to this
question, that
Wickham still
cherished the
hope of more
effectually
making his
fortune by
marriage, in
some other
country. Under
such
circumstances,
however, he was
not likely to
be proof
against the
temptation of
immediate
relief. They
met several
times, for
there was much
to be
discussed.
Wickham, of
course, wanted
more than he
could get; but
at length was
reduced to be
reasonable.
Everything
being settled
between _them_,
Mr. Darcy’s
next step was
to make your
uncle
acquainted with
it, and he
first called in
Gracechurch
Street the
evening before
I came home.
But Mr.
Gardiner could
not be seen;
and Mr. Darcy
found, on
further
inquiry, that
your father was
still with him,
but would quit
town the next
morning. He did
not judge your
father to be a
person whom he
could so
properly
consult as your
uncle, and
therefore
readily
postponed
seeing him till
after the
departure of
the former. He
did not leave
his name, and
till the next
day it was only
known that a
gentleman had
called on
business. On
Saturday he
came again.
Your father was
gone, your
uncle at home,
and, as I said
before, they
had a great
deal of talk
together. They
met again on
Sunday, and
then _I_ saw
him too. It was
not all settled
before Monday:
as soon as it
was, the
express was
sent off to
Longbourn. But
our visitor was
very obstinate.
I fancy, Lizzy,
that obstinacy
is the real
defect of his
character,
after all. He
has been
accused of many
faults at
different
times; but
_this_ is the
true one.
Nothing was to
be done that he
did not do
himself; though
I am sure (and
I do not speak
it to be
thanked,
therefore say
nothing about
it) your uncle
would most
readily have
settled the
whole. They
battled it
together for a
long time,
which was more
than either the
gentleman or
lady concerned
in it deserved.
But at last
your uncle was
forced to
yield, and
instead of
being allowed
to be of use to
his niece, was
forced to put
up with only
having the
probable credit
of it, which
went sorely
against the
grain; and I
really believe
your letter
this morning
gave him great
pleasure,
because it
required an
explanation
that would rob
him of his
borrowed
feathers, and
give the praise
where it was
due. But,
Lizzy, this
must go no
further than
yourself, or
Jane at most.
You know pretty
well, I
suppose, what
has been done
for the young
people. His
debts are to be
paid,
amounting, I
believe, to
considerably
more than a
thousand
pounds, another
thousand in
addition to her
own settled
upon _her_, and
his commission
purchased. The
reason why all
this was to be
done by him
alone, was such
as I have given
above. It was
owing to him,
to his reserve
and want of
proper
consideration,
that Wickham’s
character had
been so
misunderstood,
and
consequently
that he had
been received
and noticed as
he was. Perhaps
there was some
truth in
_this_; though
I doubt whether
_his_ reserve,
or _anybody’s_
reserve can be
answerable for
the event. But
in spite of all
this fine
talking, my
dear Lizzy, you
may rest
perfectly
assured that
your uncle
would never
have yielded,
if we had not
given him
credit for
_another
interest_ in
the affair.
When all this
was resolved
on, he returned
again to his
friends, who
were still
staying at
Pemberley; but
it was agreed
that he should
be in London
once more when
the wedding
took place, and
all money
matters were
then to receive
the last
finish. I
believe I have
now told you
everything. It
is a relation
which you tell
me is to give
you great
surprise; I
hope at least
it will not
afford you any
displeasure.
Lydia came to
us, and Wickham
had constant
admission to
the house. _He_
was exactly
what he had
been when I
knew him in
Hertfordshire;
but I would not
tell you how
little I was
satisfied with
_her_ behaviour
while she
stayed with us,
if I had not
perceived, by
Jane’s letter
last Wednesday,
that her
conduct on
coming home was
exactly of a
piece with it,
and therefore
what I now tell
you can give
you no fresh
pain. I talked
to her
repeatedly in
the most
serious manner,
representing to
her the
wickedness of
what she had
done, and all
the unhappiness
she had brought
on her family.
If she heard
me, it was by
good luck, for
I am sure she
did not listen.
I was sometimes
quite provoked;
but then I
recollected my
dear Elizabeth
and Jane, and
for their sakes
had patience
with her. Mr.
Darcy was
punctual in his
return, and, as
Lydia informed
you, attended
the wedding. He
dined with us
the next day,
and was to
leave town
again on
Wednesday or
Thursday. Will
you be very
angry with me,
my dear Lizzy,
if I take this
opportunity of
saying (what I
was never bold
enough to say
before) how
much I like
him? His
behaviour to us
has, in every
respect, been
as pleasing as
when we were in
Derbyshire. His
understanding
and opinions
all please me;
he wants
nothing but a
little more
liveliness, and
_that_, if he
marry
_prudently_,
his wife may
teach him. I
thought him
very sly; he
hardly ever
mentioned your
name. But
slyness seems
the fashion.
Pray forgive
me, if I have
been very
presuming, or
at least do not
punish me so
far as to
exclude me from
P. I shall
never be quite
happy till I
have been all
round the park.
A low phaeton
with a nice
little pair of
ponies would be
the very thing.
But I must
write no more.
The children
have been
wanting me this
half hour.
“Yours, very
sincerely, “M.
GARDINER.”

=====

As soon as they
were gone,
Elizabeth
walked out to
recover her
spirits; or, in
other words, to
dwell without
interruption on
those subjects
which must
deaden them
more. Mr.
Darcy’s
behaviour
astonished and
vexed her.
“Why, if he
came only to be
silent, grave,
and
indifferent,”
said she, “did
he come at
all?” She could
settle it in no
way that gave
her pleasure.
“He could be
still amiable,
still pleasing
to my uncle and
aunt, when he
was in town;
and why not to
me? If he fears
me, why come
hither? If he
no longer cares
for me, why
silent?
Teasing,
teasing man! I
will think no
more about
him.” Her
resolution was
for a short
time
involuntarily
kept by the
approach of her
sister, who
joined her with
a cheerful look
which showed
her better
satisfied with
their visitors
than Elizabeth.
“Now,” said
she, “that this
first meeting
is over, I feel
perfectly easy.
I know my own
strength, and I
shall never be
embarrassed
again by his
coming. I am
glad he dines
here on
Tuesday. It
will then be
publicly seen,
that on both
sides we meet
only as common
and indifferent
acquaintance.”
“Yes, very
indifferent,
indeed,” said
Elizabeth,
laughingly.
“Oh, Jane! take
care.” “My dear
Lizzy, you
cannot think me
so weak as to
be in danger
now.” “I think
you are in very
great danger of
making him as
much in love
with you as
ever.” They did
not see the
gentlemen again
till Tuesday;
and Mrs.
Bennet, in the
meanwhile, was
giving way to
all the happy
schemes which
the good-humour
and common
politeness of
Bingley, in
half an hour’s
visit, had
revived. On
Tuesday there
was a large
party assembled
at Longbourn;
and the two who
were most
anxiously
expected, to
the credit of
their
punctuality as
sportsmen, were
in very good
time. When they
repaired to the
dining-room,
Elizabeth
eagerly watched
to see whether
Bingley would
take the place
which, in all
their former
parties, had
belonged to
him, by her
sister. Her
prudent mother,
occupied by the
same ideas,
forbore to
invite him to
sit by herself.
On entering the
room, he seemed
to hesitate;
but Jane
happened to
look round, and
happened to
smile: it was
decided. He
placed himself
by her.
Elizabeth, with
a triumphant
sensation,
looked towards
his friend. He
bore it with
noble
indifference;
and she would
have imagined
that Bingley
had received
his sanction to
be happy, had
she not seen
his eyes
likewise turned
towards Mr.
Darcy, with an
expression of
half-laughing
alarm. His
behaviour to
her sister was
such during
dinnertime as
showed an
admiration of
her, which,
though more
guarded than
formerly,
persuaded
Elizabeth,
that, if left
wholly to
himself, Jane’s
happiness, and
his own, would
be speedily
secured. Though
she dared not
depend upon the
consequence,
she yet
received
pleasure from
observing his
behaviour. It
gave her all
the animation
that her
spirits could
boast; for she
was in no
cheerful
humour. Mr.
Darcy was
almost as far
from her as the
table could
divide them. He
was on one side
of her mother.
She knew how
little such a
situation would
give pleasure
to either, or
make either
appear to
advantage. She
was not near
enough to hear
any of their
discourse; but
she could see
how seldom they
spoke to each
other, and how
formal and cold
was their
manner whenever
they did. Her
mother’s
ungraciousness
made the sense
of what they
owed him more
painful to
Elizabeth’s
mind; and she
would, at
times, have
given anything
to be
privileged to
tell him, that
his kindness
was neither
unknown nor
unfelt by the
whole of the
family. She was
in hopes that
the evening
would afford
some
opportunity of
bringing them
together; that
the whole of
the visit would
not pass away
without
enabling them
to enter into
something more
of
conversation,
than the mere
ceremonious
salutation
attending his
entrance.
Anxious and
uneasy, the
period which
passed in the
drawing-room
before the
gentlemen came,
was wearisome
and dull to a
degree that
almost made her
uncivil. She
looked forward
to their
entrance as the
point on which
all her chance
of pleasure for
the evening
must depend.
“If he does not
come to me,
_then_,” said
she, “I shall
give him up for
ever.” The
gentlemen came;
and she thought
he looked as if
he would have
answered her
hopes; but,
alas! the
ladies had
crowded round
the table,
where Miss
Bennet was
making tea, and
Elizabeth
pouring out the
coffee, in so
close a
confederacy,
that there was
not a single
vacancy near
her which would
admit of a
chair. And on
the gentlemen’s
approaching,
one of the
girls moved
closer to her
than ever, and
said, in a
whisper,-- “The
men shan’t come
and part us, I
am determined.
We want none of
them; do we?”
Darcy had
walked away to
another part of
the room. She
followed him
with her eyes,
envied everyone
to whom he
spoke, had
scarcely
patience enough
to help anybody
to coffee, and
then was
enraged against
herself for
being so silly!
“A man who has
once been
refused! How
could I ever be
foolish enough
to expect a
renewal of his
love? Is there
one among the
sex who would
not protest
against such a
weakness as a
second proposal
to the same
woman? There is
no indignity so
abhorrent to
their
feelings.” She
was a little
revived,
however, by his
bringing back
his coffee-cup
himself; and
she seized the
opportunity of
saying,-- “Is
your sister at
Pemberley
still?” “Yes;
she will remain
there till
Christmas.”
“And quite
alone? Have all
her friends
left her?”
“Mrs. Annesley
is with her.
The others have
been gone on to
Scarborough
these three
weeks.” She
could think of
nothing more to
say; but if he
wished to
converse with
her, he might
have better
success. He
stood by her,
however, for
some minutes,
in silence;
and, at last,
on the young
lady’s
whispering to
Elizabeth
again, he
walked away.
When the tea
things were
removed, and
the card tables
placed, the
ladies all
rose; and
Elizabeth was
then hoping to
be soon joined
by him, when
all her views
were
overthrown, by
seeing him fall
a victim to her
mother’s
rapacity for
whist players,
and in a few
moments after
seated with the
rest of the
party. She now
lost every
expectation of
pleasure. They
were confined
for the evening
at different
tables; and she
had nothing to
hope, but that
his eyes were
so often turned
towards her
side of the
room, as to
make him play
as
unsuccessfully
as herself.
Mrs. Bennet had
designed to
keep the two
Netherfield
gentlemen to
supper; but
their carriage
was, unluckily,
ordered before
any of the
others, and she
had no
opportunity of
detaining them.
“Well, girls,”
said she, as
soon as they
were left to
themselves,
“what say you
to the day? I
think
everything has
passed off
uncommonly
well, I assure
you. The dinner
was as well
dressed as any
I ever saw. The
venison was
roasted to a
turn--and
everybody said,
they never saw
so fat a
haunch. The
soup was fifty
times better
than what we
had at the
Lucases’ last
week; and even
Mr. Darcy
acknowledged
that the
partridges were
remarkably well
done; and I
suppose he has
two or three
French cooks at
least. And, my
dear Jane, I
never saw you
look in greater
beauty. Mrs.
Long said so
too, for I
asked her
whether you did
not. And what
do you think
she said
besides? ‘Ah!
Mrs. Bennet, we
shall have her
at Netherfield
at last!’ She
did, indeed. I
do think Mrs.
Long is as good
a creature as
ever lived--and
her nieces are
very pretty
behaved girls,
and not at all
handsome: I
like them
prodigiously.”

=====

Mrs. Bennet, in
short, was in
very great
spirits: she
had seen enough
of Bingley’s
behaviour to
Jane to be
convinced that
she would get
him at last;
and her
expectations of
advantage to
her family,
when in a happy
humour, were so
far beyond
reason, that
she was quite
disappointed at
not seeing him
there again the
next day, to
make his
proposals. “It
has been a very
agreeable day,”
said Miss
Bennet to
Elizabeth. “The
party seemed so
well selected,
so suitable one
with the other.
I hope we may
often meet
again.”
Elizabeth
smiled. “Lizzy,
you must not do
so. You must
not suspect me.
It mortifies
me. I assure
you that I have
now learnt to
enjoy his
conversation as
an agreeable
and sensible
young man
without having
a wish beyond
it. I am
perfectly
satisfied, from
what his
manners now
are, that he
never had any
design of
engaging my
affection. It
is only that he
is blessed with
greater
sweetness of
address, and a
stronger desire
of generally
pleasing, than
any other man.”
“You are very
cruel,” said
her sister,
“you will not
let me smile,
and are
provoking me to
it every
moment.” “How
hard it is in
some cases to
be believed!
And how
impossible in
others! But why
should you wish
to persuade me
that I feel
more than I
acknowledge?”
“That is a
question which
I hardly know
how to answer.
We all love to
instruct,
though we can
teach only what
is not worth
knowing.
Forgive me; and
if you persist
in
indifference,
do not make
_me_ your
confidante.”

=====

A few days
after this
visit, Mr.
Bingley called
again, and
alone. His
friend had left
him that
morning for
London, but was
to return home
in ten days’
time. He sat
with them above
an hour, and
was in
remarkably good
spirits. Mrs.
Bennet invited
him to dine
with them; but,
with many
expressions of
concern, he
confessed
himself engaged
elsewhere.
“Next time you
call,” said
she, “I hope we
shall be more
lucky.” He
should be
particularly
happy at any
time, etc.,
etc.; and if
she would give
him leave,
would take an
early
opportunity of
waiting on
them. “Can you
come
to-morrow?”
Yes, he had no
engagement at
all for
to-morrow; and
her invitation
was accepted
with alacrity.
He came, and in
such very good
time, that the
ladies were
none of them
dressed. In ran
Mrs. Bennet to
her daughters’
room, in her
dressing-gown,
and with her
hair half
finished,
crying out,--
“My dear Jane,
make haste and
hurry down. He
is come--Mr.
Bingley is
come. He is,
indeed. Make
haste, make
haste. Here,
Sarah, come to
Miss Bennet
this moment,
and help her on
with her gown.
Never mind Miss
Lizzy’s hair.”
“We will be
down as soon as
we can,” said
Jane; “but I
dare say Kitty
is forwarder
than either of
us, for she
went upstairs
half an hour
ago.” “Oh! hang
Kitty! what has
she to do with
it? Come, be
quick, be
quick! where is
your sash, my
dear?” But when
her mother was
gone, Jane
would not be
prevailed on to
go down without
one of her
sisters. The
same anxiety to
get them by
themselves was
visible again
in the evening.
After tea, Mr.
Bennet retired
to the library,
as was his
custom, and
Mary went
upstairs to her
instrument. Two
obstacles of
the five being
thus removed,
Mrs. Bennet sat
looking and
winking at
Elizabeth and
Catherine for a
considerable
time, without
making any
impression on
them. Elizabeth
would not
observe her;
and when at
last Kitty did,
she very
innocently
said, “What is
the matter,
mamma? What do
you keep
winking at me
for? What am I
to do?”
“Nothing,
child, nothing.
I did not wink
at you.” She
then sat still
five minutes
longer; but
unable to waste
such a precious
occasion, she
suddenly got
up, and saying
to Kitty,--
“Come here, my
love, I want to
speak to you,”
took her out of
the room. Jane
instantly gave
a look at
Elizabeth which
spoke her
distress at
such
premeditation,
and her
entreaty that
_she_ would not
give in to it.
In a few
minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half
opened the door
and called
out,-- “Lizzy,
my dear, I want
to speak with
you.” Elizabeth
was forced to
go. “We may as
well leave them
by themselves,
you know,” said
her mother as
soon as she was
in the hall.
“Kitty and I
are going
upstairs to sit
in my
dressing-room.”
Elizabeth made
no attempt to
reason with her
mother, but
remained
quietly in the
hall till she
and Kitty were
out of sight,
then returned
into the
drawing-room.
Mrs. Bennet’s
schemes for
this day were
ineffectual.
Bingley was
everything that
was charming,
except the
professed lover
of her
daughter. His
ease and
cheerfulness
rendered him a
most agreeable
addition to
their evening
party; and he
bore with the
ill-judged
officiousness
of the mother,
and heard all
her silly
remarks with a
forbearance and
command of
countenance
particularly
grateful to the
daughter. He
scarcely needed
an invitation
to stay supper;
and before he
went away an
engagement was
formed, chiefly
through his own
and Mrs.
Bennet’s means,
for his coming
next morning to
shoot with her
husband. After
this day, Jane
said no more of
her
indifference.
Not a word
passed between
the sisters
concerning
Bingley; but
Elizabeth went
to bed in the
happy belief
that all must
speedily be
concluded,
unless Mr.
Darcy returned
within the
stated time.
Seriously,
however, she
felt tolerably
persuaded that
all this must
have taken
place with that
gentleman’s
concurrence.
Bingley was
punctual to his
appointment;
and he and Mr.
Bennet spent
the morning
together, as
had been agreed
on. The latter
was much more
agreeable than
his companion
expected. There
was nothing of
presumption or
folly in
Bingley that
could provoke
his ridicule,
or disgust him
into silence;
and he was more
communicative,
and less
eccentric, than
the other had
ever seen him.
Bingley of
course returned
with him to
dinner; and in
the evening
Mrs. Bennet’s
invention was
again at work
to get
everybody away
from him and
her daughter.
Elizabeth, who
had a letter to
write, went
into the
breakfast-room
for that
purpose soon
after tea; for
as the others
were all going
to sit down to
cards, she
could not be
wanted to
counteract her
mother’s
schemes. But on
her returning
to the
drawing-room,
when her letter
was finished,
she saw, to her
infinite
surprise, there
was reason to
fear that her
mother had been
too ingenious
for her. On
opening the
door, she
perceived her
sister and
Bingley
standing
together over
the hearth, as
if engaged in
earnest
conversation;
and had this
led to no
suspicion, the
faces of both,
as they hastily
turned round
and moved away
from each
other, would
have told it
all. _Their_
situation was
awkward enough;
but _hers_ she
thought was
still worse.
Not a syllable
was uttered by
either; and
Elizabeth was
on the point of
going away
again, when
Bingley, who as
well as the
other had sat
down, suddenly
rose, and,
whispering a
few words to
her sister, ran
out of the
room. Jane
could have no
reserves from
Elizabeth,
where
confidence
would give
pleasure; and,
instantly
embracing her,
acknowledged,
with the
liveliest
emotion, that
she was the
happiest
creature in the
world. “’Tis
too much!” she
added, “by far
too much. I do
not deserve it.
Oh, why is not
everybody as
happy?”
Elizabeth’s
congratulations
were given with
a sincerity, a
warmth, a
delight, which
words could but
poorly express.
Every sentence
of kindness was
a fresh source
of happiness to
Jane. But she
would not allow
herself to stay
with her
sister, or say
half that
remained to be
said, for the
present. “I
must go
instantly to my
mother,” she
cried. “I would
not on any
account trifle
with her
affectionate
solicitude, or
allow her to
hear it from
anyone but
myself. He is
gone to my
father already.
Oh, Lizzy, to
know that what
I have to
relate will
give such
pleasure to all
my dear family!
how shall I
bear so much
happiness?” She
then hastened
away to her
mother, who had
purposely
broken up the
card-party, and
was sitting
upstairs with
Kitty.
Elizabeth, who
was left by
herself, now
smiled at the
rapidity and
ease with which
an affair was
finally
settled, that
had given them
so many
previous months
of suspense and
vexation. “And
this,” said
she, “is the
end of all his
friend’s
anxious
circumspection!
of all his
sister’s
falsehood and
contrivance!
the happiest,
wisest, and
most reasonable
end!” In a few
minutes she was
joined by
Bingley, whose
conference with
her father had
been short and
to the purpose.
“Where is your
sister?” said
he hastily, as
he opened the
door. “With my
mother
upstairs. She
will be down in
a moment, I
dare say.” He
then shut the
door, and,
coming up to
her, claimed
the good wishes
and affection
of a sister.
Elizabeth
honestly and
heartily
expressed her
delight in the
prospect of
their
relationship.
They shook
hands with
great
cordiality; and
then, till her
sister came
down, she had
to listen to
all he had to
say of his own
happiness, and
of Jane’s
perfections;
and in spite of
his being a
lover,
Elizabeth
really believed
all his
expectations of
felicity to be
rationally
founded,
because they
had for basis
the excellent
understanding
and
super-excellent
disposition of
Jane, and a
general
similarity of
feeling and
taste between
her and
himself. It was
an evening of
no common
delight to them
all; the
satisfaction of
Miss Bennet’s
mind gave such
a glow of sweet
animation to
her face, as
made her look
handsomer than
ever. Kitty
simpered and
smiled, and
hoped her turn
was coming
soon. Mrs.
Bennet could
not give her
consent, or
speak her
approbation in
terms warm
enough to
satisfy her
feelings,
though she
talked to
Bingley of
nothing else,
for half an
hour; and when
Mr. Bennet
joined them at
supper, his
voice and
manner plainly
showed how
really happy he
was. Not a
word, however,
passed his lips
in allusion to
it, till their
visitor took
his leave for
the night; but
as soon as he
was gone, he
turned to his
daughter and
said,-- “Jane,
I congratulate
you. You will
be a very happy
woman.” Jane
went to him
instantly,
kissed him, and
thanked him for
his goodness.
“You are a good
girl,” he
replied, “and I
have great
pleasure in
thinking you
will be so
happily
settled. I have
not a doubt of
your doing very
well together.
Your tempers
are by no means
unlike. You are
each of you so
complying, that
nothing will
ever be
resolved on; so
easy, that
every servant
will cheat you;
and so
generous, that
you will always
exceed your
income.” “I
hope not so.
Imprudence or
thoughtlessness
in money
matters would
be unpardonable
in _me_.”
“Exceed their
income! My dear
Mr. Bennet,”
cried his wife,
“what are you
talking of?
Why, he has
four or five
thousand a
year, and very
likely more.”
Then addressing
her daughter,
“Oh, my dear,
dear Jane, I am
so happy! I am
sure I shan’t
get a wink of
sleep all
night. I knew
how it would
be. I always
said it must be
so, at last. I
was sure you
could not be so
beautiful for
nothing! I
remember, as
soon as ever I
saw him, when
he first came
into
Hertfordshire
last year, I
thought how
likely it was
that you should
come together.
Oh, he is the
handsomest
young man that
ever was seen!”
Wickham, Lydia,
were all
forgotten. Jane
was beyond
competition her
favourite
child. At that
moment she
cared for no
other. Her
younger sisters
soon began to
make interest
with her for
objects of
happiness which
she might in
future be able
to dispense.
Mary petitioned
for the use of
the library at
Netherfield;
and Kitty
begged very
hard for a few
balls there
every winter.
Bingley, from
this time, was
of course a
daily visitor
at Longbourn;
coming
frequently
before
breakfast, and
always
remaining till
after supper;
unless when
some barbarous
neighbour, who
could not be
enough
detested, had
given him an
invitation to
dinner, which
he thought
himself obliged
to accept.
Elizabeth had
now but little
time for
conversation
with her
sister; for
while he was
present Jane
had no
attention to
bestow on
anyone else:
but she found
herself
considerably
useful to both
of them, in
those hours of
separation that
must sometimes
occur. In the
absence of
Jane, he always
attached
himself to
Elizabeth for
the pleasure of
talking of her;
and when
Bingley was
gone, Jane
constantly
sought the same
means of
relief. “He has
made me so
happy,” said
she, one
evening, “by
telling me that
he was totally
ignorant of my
being in town
last spring! I
had not
believed it
possible.” “I
suspected as
much,” replied
Elizabeth. “But
how did he
account for
it?” “It must
have been his
sisters’ doing.
They were
certainly no
friends to his
acquaintance
with me, which
I cannot wonder
at, since he
might have
chosen so much
more
advantageously
in many
respects. But
when they see,
as I trust they
will, that
their brother
is happy with
me, they will
learn to be
contented, and
we shall be on
good terms
again: though
we can never be
what we once
were to each
other.” “That
is the most
unforgiving
speech,” said
Elizabeth,
“that I ever
heard you
utter. Good
girl! It would
vex me, indeed,
to see you
again the dupe
of Miss
Bingley’s
pretended
regard.” “Would
you believe it,
Lizzy, that
when he went to
town last
November he
really loved
me, and nothing
but a
persuasion of
_my_ being
indifferent
would have
prevented his
coming down
again?” “He
made a little
mistake, to be
sure; but it is
to the credit
of his
modesty.” This
naturally
introduced a
panegyric from
Jane on his
diffidence, and
the little
value he put on
his own good
qualities.
Elizabeth was
pleased to find
that he had not
betrayed the
interference of
his friend;
for, though
Jane had the
most generous
and forgiving
heart in the
world, she knew
it was a
circumstance
which must
prejudice her
against him. “I
am certainly
the most
fortunate
creature that
ever existed!”
cried Jane.
“Oh, Lizzy, why
am I thus
singled from my
family, and
blessed above
them all? If I
could but see
you as happy!
If there were
but such
another man for
you!” “If you
were to give me
forty such men
I never could
be so happy as
you. Till I
have your
disposition,
your goodness,
I never can
have your
happiness. No,
no, let me
shift for
myself; and,
perhaps, if I
have very good
luck, I may
meet with
another Mr.
Collins in
time.” The
situation of
affairs in the
Longbourn
family could
not be long a
secret. Mrs.
Bennet was
privileged to
whisper it to
Mrs. Philips,
and she
ventured,
without any
permission, to
do the same by
all her
neighbours in
Meryton. The
Bennets were
speedily
pronounced to
be the luckiest
family in the
world; though
only a few
weeks before,
when Lydia had
first run away,
they had been
generally
proved to be
marked out for
misfortune.

=====

Happy for all
her maternal
feelings was
the day on
which Mrs.
Bennet got rid
of her two most
deserving
daughters. With
what delighted
pride she
afterwards
visited Mrs.
Bingley, and
talked of Mrs.
Darcy, may be
guessed. I wish
I could say,
for the sake of
her family,
that the
accomplishment
of her earnest
desire in the
establishment
of so many of
her children
produced so
happy an effect
as to make her
a sensible,
amiable,
well-informed
woman for the
rest of her
life; though,
perhaps, it was
lucky for her
husband, who
might not have
relished
domestic
felicity in so
unusual a form,
that she still
was
occasionally
nervous and
invariably
silly. Mr.
Bennet missed
his second
daughter
exceedingly;
his affection
for her drew
him oftener
from home than
anything else
could do. He
delighted in
going to
Pemberley,
especially when
he was least
expected. Mr.
Bingley and
Jane remained
at Netherfield
only a
twelvemonth. So
near a vicinity
to her mother
and Meryton
relations was
not desirable
even to _his_
easy temper, or
_her_
affectionate
heart. The
darling wish of
his sisters was
then gratified:
he bought an
estate in a
neighbouring
county to
Derbyshire; and
Jane and
Elizabeth, in
addition to
every other
source of
happiness, were
within thirty
miles of each
other. Kitty,
to her very
material
advantage,
spent the chief
of her time
with her two
elder sisters.
In society so
superior to
what she had
generally
known, her
improvement was
great. She was
not of so
ungovernable a
temper as
Lydia; and,
removed from
the influence
of Lydia’s
example, she
became, by
proper
attention and
management,
less irritable,
less ignorant,
and less
insipid. From
the further
disadvantage of
Lydia’s society
she was of
course
carefully kept;
and though Mrs.
Wickham
frequently
invited her to
come and stay
with her, with
the promise of
balls and young
men, her father
would never
consent to her
going. Mary was
the only
daughter who
remained at
home; and she
was necessarily
drawn from the
pursuit of
accomplishments
by Mrs.
Bennet’s being
quite unable to
sit alone. Mary
was obliged to
mix more with
the world, but
she could still
moralize over
every morning
visit; and as
she was no
longer
mortified by
comparisons
between her
sisters’ beauty
and her own, it
was suspected
by her father
that she
submitted to
the change
without much
reluctance. As
for Wickham and
Lydia, their
characters
suffered no
revolution from
the marriage of
her sisters. He
bore with
philosophy the
conviction that
Elizabeth must
now become
acquainted with
whatever of his
ingratitude and
falsehood had
before been
unknown to her;
and, in spite
of everything,
was not wholly
without hope
that Darcy
might yet be
prevailed on to
make his
fortune. The
congratulatory
letter which
Elizabeth
received from
Lydia on her
marriage
explained to
her that, by
his wife at
least, if not
by himself,
such a hope was
cherished. The
letter was to
this effect:--
/* “My dear
Lizzy, */ “I
wish you joy.
If you love Mr.
Darcy half so
well as I do my
dear Wickham,
you must be
very happy. It
is a great
comfort to have
you so rich;
and when you
have nothing
else to do, I
hope you will
think of us. I
am sure Wickham
would like a
place at court
very much; and
I do not think
we shall have
quite money
enough to live
upon without
some help. Any
place would do
of about three
or four hundred
a year; but,
however, do not
speak to Mr.
Darcy about it,
if you had
rather not.
“Yours,” etc.
As it happened
that Elizabeth
had much rather
not, she
endeavoured in
her answer to
put an end to
every entreaty
and expectation
of the kind.
Such relief,
however, as it
was in her
power to
afford, by the
practice of
what might be
called economy
in her own
private
expenses, she
frequently sent
them. It had
always been
evident to her
that such an
income as
theirs, under
the direction
of two persons
so extravagant
in their wants,
and heedless of
the future,
must be very
insufficient to
their support;
and whenever
they changed
their quarters,
either Jane or
herself were
sure of being
applied to for
some little
assistance
towards
discharging
their bills.
Their manner of
living, even
when the
restoration of
peace dismissed
them to a home,
was unsettled
in the extreme.
They were
always moving
from place to
place in quest
of a cheap
situation, and
always spending
more than they
ought. His
affection for
her soon sunk
into
indifference:
hers lasted a
little longer;
and, in spite
of her youth
and her
manners, she
retained all
the claims to
reputation
which her
marriage had
given her.
Though Darcy
could never
receive _him_
at Pemberley,
yet, for
Elizabeth’s
sake, he
assisted him
further in his
profession.
Lydia was
occasionally a
visitor there,
when her
husband was
gone to enjoy
himself in
London or Bath;
and with the
Bingleys they
both of them
frequently
stayed so long,
that even
Bingley’s
good-humour was
overcome, and
he proceeded so
far as to
_talk_ of
giving them a
hint to be
gone. Miss
Bingley was
very deeply
mortified by
Darcy’s
marriage; but
as she thought
it advisable to
retain the
right of
visiting at
Pemberley, she
dropped all her
resentment; was
fonder than
ever of
Georgiana,
almost as
attentive to
Darcy as
heretofore, and
paid off every
arrear of
civility to
Elizabeth.
Pemberley was
now Georgiana’s
home; and the
attachment of
the sisters was
exactly what
Darcy had hoped
to see. They
were able to
love each
other, even as
well as they
intended.
Georgiana had
the highest
opinion in the
world of
Elizabeth;
though at first
she often
listened with
an astonishment
bordering on
alarm at her
lively,
sportive manner
of talking to
her brother.
He, who had
always inspired
in herself a
respect which
almost overcame
her affection,
she now saw the
object of open
pleasantry. Her
mind received
knowledge which
had never
before fallen
in her way. By
Elizabeth’s
instructions
she began to
comprehend that
a woman may
take liberties
with her
husband, which
a brother will
not always
allow in a
sister more
than ten years
younger than
himself. Lady
Catherine was
extremely
indignant on
the marriage of
her nephew; and
as she gave way
to all the
genuine
frankness of
her character,
in her reply to
the letter
which announced
its
arrangement,
she sent him
language so
very abusive,
especially of
Elizabeth, that
for some time
all intercourse
was at an end.
But at length,
by Elizabeth’s
persuasion, he
was prevailed
on to overlook
the offence,
and seek a
reconciliation;
and, after a
little further
resistance on
the part of his
aunt, her
resentment gave
way, either to
her affection
for him, or her
curiosity to
see how his
wife conducted
herself; and
she
condescended to
wait on them at
Pemberley, in
spite of that
pollution which
its woods had
received, not
merely from the
presence of
such a
mistress, but
the visits of
her uncle and
aunt from the
city. With the
Gardiners they
were always on
the most
intimate terms.
Darcy, as well
as Elizabeth,
really loved
them; and they
were both ever
sensible of the
warmest
gratitude
towards the
persons who, by
bringing her
into
Derbyshire, had
been the means
of uniting
them.

=====

Either the well
was very deep,
or she fell
very slowly,
for she had
plenty of time
as she went
down to look
about her and
to wonder what
was going to
happen next.
First, she
tried to look
down and make
out what she
was coming to,
but it was too
dark to see
anything; then
she looked at
the sides of
the well, and
noticed that
they were
filled with
cupboards and
book-shelves;
here and there
she saw maps
and pictures
hung upon pegs.
She took down a
jar from one of
the shelves as
she passed; it
was labelled
“ORANGE
MARMALADE”, but
to her great
disappointment
it was empty:
she did not
like to drop
the jar for
fear of killing
somebody
underneath, so
managed to put
it into one of
the cupboards
as she fell
past it.

=====

Down, down,
down. Would the
fall _never_
come to an end?
“I wonder how
many miles I’ve
fallen by this
time?” she said
aloud. “I must
be getting
somewhere near
the centre of
the earth. Let
me see: that
would be four
thousand miles
down, I think—”
(for, you see,
Alice had
learnt several
things of this
sort in her
lessons in the
schoolroom, and
though this was
not a _very_
good
opportunity for
showing off her
knowledge, as
there was no
one to listen
to her, still
it was good
practice to say
it over) “—yes,
that’s about
the right
distance—but
then I wonder
what Latitude
or Longitude
I’ve got to?”
(Alice had no
idea what
Latitude was,
or Longitude
either, but
thought they
were nice grand
words to say.)

=====

Presently she
began again. “I
wonder if I
shall fall
right _through_
the earth! How
funny it’ll
seem to come
out among the
people that
walk with their
heads downward!
The
Antipathies, I
think—” (she
was rather glad
there _was_ no
one listening,
this time, as
it didn’t sound
at all the
right word)
“—but I shall
have to ask
them what the
name of the
country is, you
know. Please,
Ma’am, is this
New Zealand or
Australia?”
(and she tried
to curtsey as
she spoke—fancy
_curtseying_ as
you’re falling
through the
air! Do you
think you could
manage it?)
“And what an
ignorant little
girl she’ll
think me for
asking! No,
it’ll never do
to ask: perhaps
I shall see it
written up
somewhere.”

=====

Down, down,
down. There was
nothing else to
do, so Alice
soon began
talking again.
“Dinah’ll miss
me very much
to-night, I
should think!”
(Dinah was the
cat.) “I hope
they’ll
remember her
saucer of milk
at tea-time.
Dinah my dear!
I wish you were
down here with
me! There are
no mice in the
air, I’m
afraid, but you
might catch a
bat, and that’s
very like a
mouse, you
know. But do
cats eat bats,
I wonder?” And
here Alice
began to get
rather sleepy,
and went on
saying to
herself, in a
dreamy sort of
way, “Do cats
eat bats? Do
cats eat bats?”
and sometimes,
“Do bats eat
cats?” for, you
see, as she
couldn’t answer
either
question, it
didn’t much
matter which
way she put it.
She felt that
she was dozing
off, and had
just begun to
dream that she
was walking
hand in hand
with Dinah, and
saying to her
very earnestly,
“Now, Dinah,
tell me the
truth: did you
ever eat a
bat?” when
suddenly,
thump! thump!
down she came
upon a heap of
sticks and dry
leaves, and the
fall was over.

=====

Alice was not a
bit hurt, and
she jumped up
on to her feet
in a moment:
she looked up,
but it was all
dark overhead;
before her was
another long
passage, and
the White
Rabbit was
still in sight,
hurrying down
it. There was
not a moment to
be lost: away
went Alice like
the wind, and
was just in
time to hear it
say, as it
turned a
corner, “Oh my
ears and
whiskers, how
late it’s
getting!” She
was close
behind it when
she turned the
corner, but the
Rabbit was no
longer to be
seen: she found
herself in a
long, low hall,
which was lit
up by a row of
lamps hanging
from the roof.

=====

Suddenly she
came upon a
little
three-legged
table, all made
of solid glass;
there was
nothing on it
except a tiny
golden key, and
Alice’s first
thought was
that it might
belong to one
of the doors of
the hall; but,
alas! either
the locks were
too large, or
the key was too
small, but at
any rate it
would not open
any of them.
However, on the
second time
round, she came
upon a low
curtain she had
not noticed
before, and
behind it was a
little door
about fifteen
inches high:
she tried the
little golden
key in the
lock, and to
her great
delight it
fitted!

=====

Alice opened
the door and
found that it
led into a
small passage,
not much larger
than a
rat-hole: she
knelt down and
looked along
the passage
into the
loveliest
garden you ever
saw. How she
longed to get
out of that
dark hall, and
wander about
among those
beds of bright
flowers and
those cool
fountains, but
she could not
even get her
head through
the doorway;
“and even if my
head would go
through,”
thought poor
Alice, “it
would be of
very little use
without my
shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I
could shut up
like a
telescope! I
think I could,
if I only knew
how to begin.”
For, you see,
so many
out-of-the-way
things had
happened
lately, that
Alice had begun
to think that
very few things
indeed were
really
impossible.

=====

It was all very
well to say
“Drink me,” but
the wise little
Alice was not
going to do
_that_ in a
hurry. “No,
I’ll look
first,” she
said, “and see
whether it’s
marked
‘_poison_’ or
not”; for she
had read
several nice
little
histories about
children who
had got burnt,
and eaten up by
wild beasts and
other
unpleasant
things, all
because they
_would_ not
remember the
simple rules
their friends
had taught
them: such as,
that a red-hot
poker will burn
you if you hold
it too long;
and that if you
cut your finger
_very_ deeply
with a knife,
it usually
bleeds; and she
had never
forgotten that,
if you drink
much from a
bottle marked
“poison,” it is
almost certain
to disagree
with you,
sooner or
later.

=====

And so it was
indeed: she was
now only ten
inches high,
and her face
brightened up
at the thought
that she was
now the right
size for going
through the
little door
into that
lovely garden.
First, however,
she waited for
a few minutes
to see if she
was going to
shrink any
further: she
felt a little
nervous about
this; “for it
might end, you
know,” said
Alice to
herself, “in my
going out
altogether,
like a candle.
I wonder what I
should be like
then?” And she
tried to fancy
what the flame
of a candle is
like after the
candle is blown
out, for she
could not
remember ever
having seen
such a thing.

=====

After a while,
finding that
nothing more
happened, she
decided on
going into the
garden at once;
but, alas for
poor Alice!
when she got to
the door, she
found she had
forgotten the
little golden
key, and when
she went back
to the table
for it, she
found she could
not possibly
reach it: she
could see it
quite plainly
through the
glass, and she
tried her best
to climb up one
of the legs of
the table, but
it was too
slippery; and
when she had
tired herself
out with
trying, the
poor little
thing sat down
and cried.

=====

“Come, there’s
no use in
crying like
that!” said
Alice to
herself, rather
sharply; “I
advise you to
leave off this
minute!” She
generally gave
herself very
good advice,
(though she
very seldom
followed it),
and sometimes
she scolded
herself so
severely as to
bring tears
into her eyes;
and once she
remembered
trying to box
her own ears
for having
cheated herself
in a game of
croquet she was
playing against
herself, for
this curious
child was very
fond of
pretending to
be two people.
“But it’s no
use now,”
thought poor
Alice, “to
pretend to be
two people!
Why, there’s
hardly enough
of me left to
make _one_
respectable
person!”

=====

“Curiouser and
curiouser!”
cried Alice
(she was so
much surprised,
that for the
moment she
quite forgot
how to speak
good English);
“now I’m
opening out
like the
largest
telescope that
ever was!
Good-bye,
feet!” (for
when she looked
down at her
feet, they
seemed to be
almost out of
sight, they
were getting so
far off). “Oh,
my poor little
feet, I wonder
who will put on
your shoes and
stockings for
you now, dears?
I’m sure _I_
shan’t be able!
I shall be a
great deal too
far off to
trouble myself
about you: you
must manage the
best way you
can;—but I must
be kind to
them,” thought
Alice, “or
perhaps they
won’t walk the
way I want to
go! Let me see:
I’ll give them
a new pair of
boots every
Christmas.”

=====

After a time
she heard a
little
pattering of
feet in the
distance, and
she hastily
dried her eyes
to see what was
coming. It was
the White
Rabbit
returning,
splendidly
dressed, with a
pair of white
kid gloves in
one hand and a
large fan in
the other: he
came trotting
along in a
great hurry,
muttering to
himself as he
came, “Oh! the
Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh!
won’t she be
savage if I’ve
kept her
waiting!” Alice
felt so
desperate that
she was ready
to ask help of
any one; so,
when the Rabbit
came near her,
she began, in a
low, timid
voice, “If you
please, sir—”
The Rabbit
started
violently,
dropped the
white kid
gloves and the
fan, and
skurried away
into the
darkness as
hard as he
could go.

=====

Alice took up
the fan and
gloves, and, as
the hall was
very hot, she
kept fanning
herself all the
time she went
on talking:
“Dear, dear!
How queer
everything is
to-day! And
yesterday
things went on
just as usual.
I wonder if
I’ve been
changed in the
night? Let me
think: was I
the same when I
got up this
morning? I
almost think I
can remember
feeling a
little
different. But
if I’m not the
same, the next
question is,
Who in the
world am I? Ah,
_that’s_ the
great puzzle!”
And she began
thinking over
all the
children she
knew that were
of the same age
as herself, to
see if she
could have been
changed for any
of them.

=====

“I’m sure I’m
not Ada,” she
said, “for her
hair goes in
such long
ringlets, and
mine doesn’t go
in ringlets at
all; and I’m
sure I can’t be
Mabel, for I
know all sorts
of things, and
she, oh! she
knows such a
very little!
Besides,
_she’s_ she,
and _I’m_ I,
and—oh dear,
how puzzling it
all is! I’ll
try if I know
all the things
I used to know.
Let me see:
four times five
is twelve, and
four times six
is thirteen,
and four times
seven is—oh
dear! I shall
never get to
twenty at that
rate! However,
the
Multiplication
Table doesn’t
signify: let’s
try Geography.
London is the
capital of
Paris, and
Paris is the
capital of
Rome, and
Rome—no,
_that’s_ all
wrong, I’m
certain! I must
have been
changed for
Mabel! I’ll try
and say ‘_How
doth the
little_—’” and
she crossed her
hands on her
lap as if she
were saying
lessons, and
began to repeat
it, but her
voice sounded
hoarse and
strange, and
the words did
not come the
same as they
used to do:—

=====

“I’m sure those
are not the
right words,”
said poor
Alice, and her
eyes filled
with tears
again as she
went on, “I
must be Mabel
after all, and
I shall have to
go and live in
that poky
little house,
and have next
to no toys to
play with, and
oh! ever so
many lessons to
learn! No, I’ve
made up my mind
about it; if
I’m Mabel, I’ll
stay down here!
It’ll be no use
their putting
their heads
down and saying
‘Come up again,
dear!’ I shall
only look up
and say ‘Who am
I then? Tell me
that first, and
then, if I like
being that
person, I’ll
come up: if
not, I’ll stay
down here till
I’m somebody
else’—but, oh
dear!” cried
Alice, with a
sudden burst of
tears, “I do
wish they
_would_ put
their heads
down! I am so
_very_ tired of
being all alone
here!”

=====

As she said
this she looked
down at her
hands, and was
surprised to
see that she
had put on one
of the Rabbit’s
little white
kid gloves
while she was
talking. “How
_can_ I have
done that?” she
thought. “I
must be growing
small again.”
She got up and
went to the
table to
measure herself
by it, and
found that, as
nearly as she
could guess,
she was now
about two feet
high, and was
going on
shrinking
rapidly: she
soon found out
that the cause
of this was the
fan she was
holding, and
she dropped it
hastily, just
in time to
avoid shrinking
away
altogether.

=====

As she said
these words her
foot slipped,
and in another
moment, splash!
she was up to
her chin in
salt water. Her
first idea was
that she had
somehow fallen
into the sea,
“and in that
case I can go
back by
railway,” she
said to
herself. (Alice
had been to the
seaside once in
her life, and
had come to the
general
conclusion,
that wherever
you go to on
the English
coast you find
a number of
bathing
machines in the
sea, some
children
digging in the
sand with
wooden spades,
then a row of
lodging houses,
and behind them
a railway
station.)
However, she
soon made out
that she was in
the pool of
tears which she
had wept when
she was nine
feet high.

=====

“Would it be of
any use, now,”
thought Alice,
“to speak to
this mouse?
Everything is
so
out-of-the-way
down here, that
I should think
very likely it
can talk: at
any rate,
there’s no harm
in trying.” So
she began: “O
Mouse, do you
know the way
out of this
pool? I am very
tired of
swimming about
here, O Mouse!”
(Alice thought
this must be
the right way
of speaking to
a mouse: she
had never done
such a thing
before, but she
remembered
having seen in
her brother’s
Latin Grammar,
“A mouse—of a
mouse—to a
mouse—a mouse—O
mouse!”) The
Mouse looked at
her rather
inquisitively,
and seemed to
her to wink
with one of its
little eyes,
but it said
nothing.

=====

“Perhaps it
doesn’t
understand
English,”
thought Alice;
“I daresay it’s
a French mouse,
come over with
William the
Conqueror.”
(For, with all
her knowledge
of history,
Alice had no
very clear
notion how long
ago anything
had happened.)
So she began
again: “Où est
ma chatte?”
which was the
first sentence
in her French
lesson-book.
The Mouse gave
a sudden leap
out of the
water, and
seemed to
quiver all over
with fright.
“Oh, I beg your
pardon!” cried
Alice hastily,
afraid that she
had hurt the
poor animal’s
feelings. “I
quite forgot
you didn’t like
cats.”

=====

“Well, perhaps
not,” said
Alice in a
soothing tone:
“don’t be angry
about it. And
yet I wish I
could show you
our cat Dinah:
I think you’d
take a fancy to
cats if you
could only see
her. She is
such a dear
quiet thing,”
Alice went on,
half to
herself, as she
swam lazily
about in the
pool, “and she
sits purring so
nicely by the
fire, licking
her paws and
washing her
face—and she is
such a nice
soft thing to
nurse—and she’s
such a capital
one for
catching
mice—oh, I beg
your pardon!”
cried Alice
again, for this
time the Mouse
was bristling
all over, and
she felt
certain it must
be really
offended. “We
won’t talk
about her any
more if you’d
rather not.”

=====

“I won’t
indeed!” said
Alice, in a
great hurry to
change the
subject of
conversation.
“Are you—are
you fond—of—of
dogs?” The
Mouse did not
answer, so
Alice went on
eagerly: “There
is such a nice
little dog near
our house I
should like to
show you! A
little
bright-eyed
terrier, you
know, with oh,
such long curly
brown hair! And
it’ll fetch
things when you
throw them, and
it’ll sit up
and beg for its
dinner, and all
sorts of
things—I can’t
remember half
of them—and it
belongs to a
farmer, you
know, and he
says it’s so
useful, it’s
worth a hundred
pounds! He says
it kills all
the rats and—oh
dear!” cried
Alice in a
sorrowful tone,
“I’m afraid
I’ve offended
it again!” For
the Mouse was
swimming away
from her as
hard as it
could go, and
making quite a
commotion in
the pool as it
went.

=====

The first
question of
course was, how
to get dry
again: they had
a consultation
about this, and
after a few
minutes it
seemed quite
natural to
Alice to find
herself talking
familiarly with
them, as if she
had known them
all her life.
Indeed, she had
quite a long
argument with
the Lory, who
at last turned
sulky, and
would only say,
“I am older
than you, and
must know
better;” and
this Alice
would not allow
without knowing
how old it was,
and, as the
Lory positively
refused to tell
its age, there
was no more to
be said.

=====

First it marked
out a
race-course, in
a sort of
circle, (“the
exact shape
doesn’t
matter,” it
said,) and then
all the party
were placed
along the
course, here
and there.
There was no
“One, two,
three, and
away,” but they
began running
when they
liked, and left
off when they
liked, so that
it was not easy
to know when
the race was
over. However,
when they had
been running
half an hour or
so, and were
quite dry
again, the Dodo
suddenly called
out “The race
is over!” and
they all
crowded round
it, panting,
and asking,
“But who has
won?”

=====

“I wish I
hadn’t
mentioned
Dinah!” she
said to herself
in a melancholy
tone. “Nobody
seems to like
her, down here,
and I’m sure
she’s the best
cat in the
world! Oh, my
dear Dinah! I
wonder if I
shall ever see
you any more!”
And here poor
Alice began to
cry again, for
she felt very
lonely and
low-spirited.
In a little
while, however,
she again heard
a little
pattering of
footsteps in
the distance,
and she looked
up eagerly,
half hoping
that the Mouse
had changed his
mind, and was
coming back to
finish his
story.

=====

It was the
White Rabbit,
trotting slowly
back again, and
looking
anxiously about
as it went, as
if it had lost
something; and
she heard it
muttering to
itself “The
Duchess! The
Duchess! Oh my
dear paws! Oh
my fur and
whiskers!
She’ll get me
executed, as
sure as ferrets
are ferrets!
Where _can_ I
have dropped
them, I
wonder?” Alice
guessed in a
moment that it
was looking for
the fan and the
pair of white
kid gloves, and
she very
good-naturedly
began hunting
about for them,
but they were
nowhere to be
seen—everything
seemed to have
changed since
her swim in the
pool, and the
great hall,
with the glass
table and the
little door,
had vanished
completely.

=====

“He took me for
his housemaid,”
she said to
herself as she
ran. “How
surprised he’ll
be when he
finds out who I
am! But I’d
better take him
his fan and
gloves—that is,
if I can find
them.” As she
said this, she
came upon a
neat little
house, on the
door of which
was a bright
brass plate
with the name
“W. RABBIT,”
engraved upon
it. She went in
without
knocking, and
hurried
upstairs, in
great fear lest
she should meet
the real Mary
Ann, and be
turned out of
the house
before she had
found the fan
and gloves.

=====

By this time
she had found
her way into a
tidy little
room with a
table in the
window, and on
it (as she had
hoped) a fan
and two or
three pairs of
tiny white kid
gloves: she
took up the fan
and a pair of
the gloves, and
was just going
to leave the
room, when her
eye fell upon a
little bottle
that stood near
the
looking-glass.
There was no
label this time
with the words
“DRINK ME,” but
nevertheless
she uncorked it
and put it to
her lips. “I
know
_something_
interesting is
sure to
happen,” she
said to
herself,
“whenever I eat
or drink
anything; so
I’ll just see
what this
bottle does. I
do hope it’ll
make me grow
large again,
for really I’m
quite tired of
being such a
tiny little
thing!”

=====

“It was much
pleasanter at
home,” thought
poor Alice,
“when one
wasn’t always
growing larger
and smaller,
and being
ordered about
by mice and
rabbits. I
almost wish I
hadn’t gone
down that
rabbit-hole—and
yet—and
yet—it’s rather
curious, you
know, this sort
of life! I do
wonder what
_can_ have
happened to me!
When I used to
read
fairy-tales, I
fancied that
kind of thing
never happened,
and now here I
am in the
middle of one!
There ought to
be a book
written about
me, that there
ought! And when
I grow up, I’ll
write one—but
I’m grown up
now,” she added
in a sorrowful
tone; “at least
there’s no room
to grow up any
more _here_.”

=====

There was a
long silence
after this, and
Alice could
only hear
whispers now
and then; such
as, “Sure, I
don’t like it,
yer honour, at
all, at all!”
“Do as I tell
you, you
coward!” and at
last she spread
out her hand
again, and made
another snatch
in the air.
This time there
were _two_
little shrieks,
and more sounds
of broken
glass. “What a
number of
cucumber-frames
there must be!”
thought Alice.
“I wonder what
they’ll do
next! As for
pulling me out
of the window,
I only wish
they _could!_
I’m sure _I_
don’t want to
stay in here
any longer!”

=====

So she
swallowed one
of the cakes,
and was
delighted to
find that she
began shrinking
directly. As
soon as she was
small enough to
get through the
door, she ran
out of the
house, and
found quite a
crowd of little
animals and
birds waiting
outside. The
poor little
Lizard, Bill,
was in the
middle, being
held up by two
guinea-pigs,
who were giving
it something
out of a
bottle. They
all made a rush
at Alice the
moment she
appeared; but
she ran off as
hard as she
could, and soon
found herself
safe in a thick
wood.

=====

Hardly knowing
what she did,
she picked up a
little bit of
stick, and held
it out to the
puppy;
whereupon the
puppy jumped
into the air
off all its
feet at once,
with a yelp of
delight, and
rushed at the
stick, and made
believe to
worry it; then
Alice dodged
behind a great
thistle, to
keep herself
from being run
over; and the
moment she
appeared on the
other side, the
puppy made
another rush at
the stick, and
tumbled head
over heels in
its hurry to
get hold of it;
then Alice,
thinking it was
very like
having a game
of play with a
cart-horse, and
expecting every
moment to be
trampled under
its feet, ran
round the
thistle again;
then the puppy
began a series
of short
charges at the
stick, running
a very little
way forwards
each time and a
long way back,
and barking
hoarsely all
the while, till
at last it sat
down a good way
off, panting,
with its tongue
hanging out of
its mouth, and
its great eyes
half shut.

=====

As there seemed
to be no chance
of getting her
hands up to her
head, she tried
to get her head
down to them,
and was
delighted to
find that her
neck would bend
about easily in
any direction,
like a serpent.
She had just
succeeded in
curving it down
into a graceful
zigzag, and was
going to dive
in among the
leaves, which
she found to be
nothing but the
tops of the
trees under
which she had
been wandering,
when a sharp
hiss made her
draw back in a
hurry: a large
pigeon had
flown into her
face, and was
beating her
violently with
its wings.

=====

“Well, be off,
then!” said the
Pigeon in a
sulky tone, as
it settled down
again into its
nest. Alice
crouched down
among the trees
as well as she
could, for her
neck kept
getting
entangled among
the branches,
and every now
and then she
had to stop and
untwist it.
After a while
she remembered
that she still
held the pieces
of mushroom in
her hands, and
she set to work
very carefully,
nibbling first
at one and then
at the other,
and growing
sometimes
taller and
sometimes
shorter, until
she had
succeeded in
bringing
herself down to
her usual
height.

=====

It was so long
since she had
been anything
near the right
size, that it
felt quite
strange at
first; but she
got used to it
in a few
minutes, and
began talking
to herself, as
usual. “Come,
there’s half my
plan done now!
How puzzling
all these
changes are!
I’m never sure
what I’m going
to be, from one
minute to
another!
However, I’ve
got back to my
right size: the
next thing is,
to get into
that beautiful
garden—how _is_
that to be
done, I
wonder?” As she
said this, she
came suddenly
upon an open
place, with a
little house in
it about four
feet high.
“Whoever lives
there,” thought
Alice, “it’ll
never do to
come upon them
_this_ size:
why, I should
frighten them
out of their
wits!” So she
began nibbling
at the
righthand bit
again, and did
not venture to
go near the
house till she
had brought
herself down to
nine inches
high.

=====

For a minute or
two she stood
looking at the
house, and
wondering what
to do next,
when suddenly a
footman in
livery came
running out of
the wood—(she
considered him
to be a footman
because he was
in livery:
otherwise,
judging by his
face only, she
would have
called him a
fish)—and
rapped loudly
at the door
with his
knuckles. It
was opened by
another footman
in livery, with
a round face,
and large eyes
like a frog;
and both
footmen, Alice
noticed, had
powdered hair
that curled all
over their
heads. She felt
very curious to
know what it
was all about,
and crept a
little way out
of the wood to
listen.

=====

“There might be
some sense in
your knocking,”
the Footman
went on without
attending to
her, “if we had
the door
between us. For
instance, if
you were
_inside_, you
might knock,
and I could let
you out, you
know.” He was
looking up into
the sky all the
time he was
speaking, and
this Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil. “But
perhaps he
can’t help it,”
she said to
herself; “his
eyes are so
_very_ nearly
at the top of
his head. But
at any rate he
might answer
questions.—How
am I to get
in?” she
repeated,
aloud.

=====

Alice did not
at all like the
tone of this
remark, and
thought it
would be as
well to
introduce some
other subject
of
conversation.
While she was
trying to fix
on one, the
cook took the
cauldron of
soup off the
fire, and at
once set to
work throwing
everything
within her
reach at the
Duchess and the
baby—the
fire-irons came
first; then
followed a
shower of
saucepans,
plates, and
dishes. The
Duchess took no
notice of them
even when they
hit her; and
the baby was
howling so much
already, that
it was quite
impossible to
say whether the
blows hurt it
or not.

=====

As soon as she
had made out
the proper way
of nursing it,
(which was to
twist it up
into a sort of
knot, and then
keep tight hold
of its right
ear and left
foot, so as to
prevent its
undoing
itself,) she
carried it out
into the open
air. “If I
don’t take this
child away with
me,” thought
Alice, “they’re
sure to kill it
in a day or
two: wouldn’t
it be murder to
leave it
behind?” She
said the last
words out loud,
and the little
thing grunted
in reply (it
had left off
sneezing by
this time).
“Don’t grunt,”
said Alice;
“that’s not at
all a proper
way of
expressing
yourself.”

=====

So she set the
little creature
down, and felt
quite relieved
to see it trot
away quietly
into the wood.
“If it had
grown up,” she
said to
herself, “it
would have made
a dreadfully
ugly child: but
it makes rather
a handsome pig,
I think.” And
she began
thinking over
other children
she knew, who
might do very
well as pigs,
and was just
saying to
herself, “if
one only knew
the right way
to change
them—” when she
was a little
startled by
seeing the
Cheshire Cat
sitting on a
bough of a tree
a few yards
off.

=====

She had not
gone much
farther before
she came in
sight of the
house of the
March Hare: she
thought it must
be the right
house, because
the chimneys
were shaped
like ears and
the roof was
thatched with
fur. It was so
large a house,
that she did
not like to go
nearer till she
had nibbled
some more of
the lefthand
bit of
mushroom, and
raised herself
to about two
feet high: even
then she walked
up towards it
rather timidly,
saying to
herself
“Suppose it
should be
raving mad
after all! I
almost wish I’d
gone to see the
Hatter
instead!”

=====

Once more she
found herself
in the long
hall, and close
to the little
glass table.
“Now, I’ll
manage better
this time,” she
said to
herself, and
began by taking
the little
golden key, and
unlocking the
door that led
into the
garden. Then
she went to
work nibbling
at the mushroom
(she had kept a
piece of it in
her pocket)
till she was
about a foot
high: then she
walked down the
little passage:
and _then_—she
found herself
at last in the
beautiful
garden, among
the bright
flower-beds and
the cool
fountains.

=====

Five and Seven
said nothing,
but looked at
Two. Two began
in a low voice,
“Why the fact
is, you see,
Miss, this here
ought to have
been a _red_
rose-tree, and
we put a white
one in by
mistake; and if
the Queen was
to find it out,
we should all
have our heads
cut off, you
know. So you
see, Miss,
we’re doing our
best, afore she
comes, to—” At
this moment
Five, who had
been anxiously
looking across
the garden,
called out “The
Queen! The
Queen!” and the
three gardeners
instantly threw
themselves flat
upon their
faces. There
was a sound of
many footsteps,
and Alice
looked round,
eager to see
the Queen.

=====

First came ten
soldiers
carrying clubs;
these were all
shaped like the
three
gardeners,
oblong and
flat, with
their hands and
feet at the
corners: next
the ten
courtiers;
these were
ornamented all
over with
diamonds, and
walked two and
two, as the
soldiers did.
After these
came the royal
children; there
were ten of
them, and the
little dears
came jumping
merrily along
hand in hand,
in couples:
they were all
ornamented with
hearts. Next
came the
guests, mostly
Kings and
Queens, and
among them
Alice
recognised the
White Rabbit:
it was talking
in a hurried
nervous manner,
smiling at
everything that
was said, and
went by without
noticing her.
Then followed
the Knave of
Hearts,
carrying the
King’s crown on
a crimson
velvet cushion;
and, last of
all this grand
procession,
came THE KING
AND QUEEN OF
HEARTS.

=====

The chief
difficulty
Alice found at
first was in
managing her
flamingo: she
succeeded in
getting its
body tucked
away,
comfortably
enough, under
her arm, with
its legs
hanging down,
but generally,
just as she had
got its neck
nicely
straightened
out, and was
going to give
the hedgehog a
blow with its
head, it
_would_ twist
itself round
and look up in
her face, with
such a puzzled
expression that
she could not
help bursting
out laughing:
and when she
had got its
head down, and
was going to
begin again, it
was very
provoking to
find that the
hedgehog had
unrolled
itself, and was
in the act of
crawling away:
besides all
this, there was
generally a
ridge or furrow
in the way
wherever she
wanted to send
the hedgehog
to, and, as the
doubled-up
soldiers were
always getting
up and walking
off to other
parts of the
ground, Alice
soon came to
the conclusion
that it was a
very difficult
game indeed.

=====

“I don’t think
they play at
all fairly,”
Alice began, in
rather a
complaining
tone, “and they
all quarrel so
dreadfully one
can’t hear
oneself
speak—and they
don’t seem to
have any rules
in particular;
at least, if
there are,
nobody attends
to them—and
you’ve no idea
how confusing
it is all the
things being
alive; for
instance,
there’s the
arch I’ve got
to go through
next walking
about at the
other end of
the ground—and
I should have
croqueted the
Queen’s
hedgehog just
now, only it
ran away when
it saw mine
coming!”

=====

“When _I’m_ a
Duchess,” she
said to
herself, (not
in a very
hopeful tone
though), “I
won’t have any
pepper in my
kitchen _at
all_. Soup does
very well
without—Maybe
it’s always
pepper that
makes people
hot-tempered,”
she went on,
very much
pleased at
having found
out a new kind
of rule, “and
vinegar that
makes them
sour—and
camomile that
makes them
bitter—and—and
barley-sugar
and such things
that make
children
sweet-tempered.
I only wish
people knew
_that_: then
they wouldn’t
be so stingy
about it, you
know—”

=====

They very soon
came upon a
Gryphon, lying
fast asleep in
the sun. (If
you don’t know
what a Gryphon
is, look at the
picture.) “Up,
lazy thing!”
said the Queen,
“and take this
young lady to
see the Mock
Turtle, and to
hear his
history. I must
go back and see
after some
executions I
have ordered;”
and she walked
off, leaving
Alice alone
with the
Gryphon. Alice
did not quite
like the look
of the
creature, but
on the whole
she thought it
would be quite
as safe to stay
with it as to
go after that
savage Queen:
so she waited.

=====

So Alice began
telling them
her adventures
from the time
when she first
saw the White
Rabbit. She was
a little
nervous about
it just at
first, the two
creatures got
so close to
her, one on
each side, and
opened their
eyes and mouths
so _very_ wide,
but she gained
courage as she
went on. Her
listeners were
perfectly quiet
till she got to
the part about
her repeating
“_You are old,
Father
William_,” to
the
Caterpillar,
and the words
all coming
different, and
then the Mock
Turtle drew a
long breath,
and said
“That’s very
curious.”

=====

The King and
Queen of Hearts
were seated on
their throne
when they
arrived, with a
great crowd
assembled about
them—all sorts
of little birds
and beasts, as
well as the
whole pack of
cards: the
Knave was
standing before
them, in
chains, with a
soldier on each
side to guard
him; and near
the King was
the White
Rabbit, with a
trumpet in one
hand, and a
scroll of
parchment in
the other. In
the very middle
of the court
was a table,
with a large
dish of tarts
upon it: they
looked so good,
that it made
Alice quite
hungry to look
at them—“I wish
they’d get the
trial done,”
she thought,
“and hand round
the
refreshments!”
But there
seemed to be no
chance of this,
so she began
looking at
everything
about her, to
pass away the
time.

=====

The long grass
rustled at her
feet as the
White Rabbit
hurried by—the
frightened
Mouse splashed
his way through
the
neighbouring
pool—she could
hear the rattle
of the teacups
as the March
Hare and his
friends shared
their
never-ending
meal, and the
shrill voice of
the Queen
ordering off
her unfortunate
guests to
execution—once
more the
pig-baby was
sneezing on the
Duchess’s knee,
while plates
and dishes
crashed around
it—once more
the shriek of
the Gryphon,
the squeaking
of the Lizard’s
slate-pencil,
and the choking
of the
suppressed
guinea-pigs,
filled the air,
mixed up with
the distant
sobs of the
miserable Mock
Turtle.

=====

So she sat on,
with closed
eyes, and half
believed
herself in
Wonderland,
though she knew
she had but to
open them
again, and all
would change to
dull
reality—the
grass would be
only rustling
in the wind,
and the pool
rippling to the
waving of the
reeds—the
rattling
teacups would
change to
tinkling
sheep-bells,
and the Queen’s
shrill cries to
the voice of
the shepherd
boy—and the
sneeze of the
baby, the
shriek of the
Gryphon, and
all the other
queer noises,
would change
(she knew) to
the confused
clamour of the
busy
farm-yard—while
the lowing of
the cattle in
the distance
would take the
place of the
Mock Turtle’s
heavy sobs.

=====

Lastly, she
pictured to
herself how
this same
little sister
of hers would,
in the
after-time, be
herself a grown
woman; and how
she would keep,
through all her
riper years,
the simple and
loving heart of
her childhood:
and how she
would gather
about her other
little
children, and
make _their_
eyes bright and
eager with many
a strange tale,
perhaps even
with the dream
of Wonderland
of long ago:
and how she
would feel with
all their
simple sorrows,
and find a
pleasure in all
their simple
joys,
remembering her
own child-life,
and the happy
summer days.

=====

III. I slept at
Baker Street
that night, and
we were engaged
upon our toast
and coffee in
the morning
when the King
of Bohemia
rushed into the
room. “You have
really got it!”
he cried,
grasping
Sherlock Holmes
by either
shoulder and
looking eagerly
into his face.
“Not yet.” “But
you have
hopes?” “I have
hopes.” “Then,
come. I am all
impatience to
be gone.” “We
must have a
cab.” “No, my
brougham is
waiting.” “Then
that will
simplify
matters.” We
descended and
started off
once more for
Briony Lodge.
“Irene Adler is
married,”
remarked
Holmes.
“Married!
When?”
“Yesterday.”
“But to whom?”
“To an English
lawyer named
Norton.” “But
she could not
love him.” “I
am in hopes
that she does.”
“And why in
hopes?”
“Because it
would spare
your Majesty
all fear of
future
annoyance. If
the lady loves
her husband,
she does not
love your
Majesty. If she
does not love
your Majesty,
there is no
reason why she
should
interfere with
your Majesty’s
plan.” “It is
true. And yet—!
Well! I wish
she had been of
my own station!
What a queen
she would have
made!” He
relapsed into a
moody silence,
which was not
broken until we
drew up in
Serpentine
Avenue. The
door of Briony
Lodge was open,
and an elderly
woman stood
upon the steps.
She watched us
with a sardonic
eye as we
stepped from
the brougham.
“Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, I
believe?” said
she. “I am Mr.
Holmes,”
answered my
companion,
looking at her
with a
questioning and
rather startled
gaze. “Indeed!
My mistress
told me that
you were likely
to call. She
left this
morning with
her husband by
the 5:15 train
from Charing
Cross for the
Continent.”
“What!”
Sherlock Holmes
staggered back,
white with
chagrin and
surprise. “Do
you mean that
she has left
England?”
“Never to
return.” “And
the papers?”
asked the King
hoarsely. “All
is lost.” “We
shall see.” He
pushed past the
servant and
rushed into the
drawing-room,
followed by the
King and
myself. The
furniture was
scattered about
in every
direction, with
dismantled
shelves and
open drawers,
as if the lady
had hurriedly
ransacked them
before her
flight. Holmes
rushed at the
bell-pull, tore
back a small
sliding
shutter, and,
plunging in his
hand, pulled
out a
photograph and
a letter. The
photograph was
of Irene Adler
herself in
evening dress,
the letter was
superscribed to
“Sherlock
Holmes, Esq. To
be left till
called for.” My
friend tore it
open, and we
all three read
it together. It
was dated at
midnight of the
preceding night
and ran in this
way: “MY DEAR
MR. SHERLOCK
HOLMES,—You
really did it
very well. You
took me in
completely.
Until after the
alarm of fire,
I had not a
suspicion. But
then, when I
found how I had
betrayed
myself, I began
to think. I had
been warned
against you
months ago. I
had been told
that, if the
King employed
an agent, it
would certainly
be you. And
your address
had been given
me. Yet, with
all this, you
made me reveal
what you wanted
to know. Even
after I became
suspicious, I
found it hard
to think evil
of such a dear,
kind old
clergyman. But,
you know, I
have been
trained as an
actress myself.
Male costume is
nothing new to
me. I often
take advantage
of the freedom
which it gives.
I sent John,
the coachman,
to watch you,
ran upstairs,
got into my
walking
clothes, as I
call them, and
came down just
as you
departed.
“Well, I
followed you to
your door, and
so made sure
that I was
really an
object of
interest to the
celebrated Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes. Then I,
rather
imprudently,
wished you
good-night, and
started for the
Temple to see
my husband. “We
both thought
the best
resource was
flight, when
pursued by so
formidable an
antagonist; so
you will find
the nest empty
when you call
to-morrow. As
to the
photograph,
your client may
rest in peace.
I love and am
loved by a
better man than
he. The King
may do what he
will without
hindrance from
one whom he has
cruelly
wronged. I keep
it only to
safeguard
myself, and to
preserve a
weapon which
will always
secure me from
any steps which
he might take
in the future.
I leave a
photograph
which he might
care to
possess; and I
remain, dear
Mr. Sherlock
Holmes,

=====

“What a
woman—oh, what
a woman!” cried
the King of
Bohemia, when
we had all
three read this
epistle. “Did I
not tell you
how quick and
resolute she
was? Would she
not have made
an admirable
queen? Is it
not a pity that
she was not on
my level?”
“From what I
have seen of
the lady, she
seems, indeed,
to be on a very
different level
to your
Majesty,” said
Holmes coldly.
“I am sorry
that I have not
been able to
bring your
Majesty’s
business to a
more successful
conclusion.”
“On the
contrary, my
dear sir,”
cried the King;
“nothing could
be more
successful. I
know that her
word is
inviolate. The
photograph is
now as safe as
if it were in
the fire.” “I
am glad to hear
your Majesty
say so.” “I am
immensely
indebted to
you. Pray tell
me in what way
I can reward
you. This
ring—” He
slipped an
emerald snake
ring from his
finger and held
it out upon the
palm of his
hand. “Your
Majesty has
something which
I should value
even more
highly,” said
Holmes. “You
have but to
name it.” “This
photograph!”
The King stared
at him in
amazement.
“Irene’s
photograph!” he
cried.
“Certainly, if
you wish it.”
“I thank your
Majesty. Then
there is no
more to be done
in the matter.
I have the
honour to wish
you a very good
morning.” He
bowed, and,
turning away
without
observing the
hand which the
King had
stretched out
to him, he set
off in my
company for his
chambers. And
that was how a
great scandal
threatened to
affect the
kingdom of
Bohemia, and
how the best
plans of Mr.
Sherlock Holmes
were beaten by
a woman’s wit.
He used to make
merry over the
cleverness of
women, but I
have not heard
him do it of
late. And when
he speaks of
Irene Adler, or
when he refers
to her
photograph, it
is always under
the honourable
title of _the_
woman.

=====

I had called
upon my friend,
Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, one day
in the autumn
of last year
and found him
in deep
conversation
with a very
stout,
florid-faced,
elderly
gentleman with
fiery red hair.
With an apology
for my
intrusion, I
was about to
withdraw when
Holmes pulled
me abruptly
into the room
and closed the
door behind me.
“You could not
possibly have
come at a
better time, my
dear Watson,”
he said
cordially. “I
was afraid that
you were
engaged.” “So I
am. Very much
so.” “Then I
can wait in the
next room.”
“Not at all.
This gentleman,
Mr. Wilson, has
been my partner
and helper in
many of my most
successful
cases, and I
have no doubt
that he will be
of the utmost
use to me in
yours also.”
The stout
gentleman half
rose from his
chair and gave
a bob of
greeting, with
a quick little
questioning
glance from his
small
fat-encircled
eyes. “Try the
settee,” said
Holmes,
relapsing into
his armchair
and putting his
fingertips
together, as
was his custom
when in
judicial moods.
“I know, my
dear Watson,
that you share
my love of all
that is bizarre
and outside the
conventions and
humdrum routine
of everyday
life. You have
shown your
relish for it
by the
enthusiasm
which has
prompted you to
chronicle, and,
if you will
excuse my
saying so,
somewhat to
embellish so
many of my own
little
adventures.”
“Your cases
have indeed
been of the
greatest
interest to
me,” I
observed. “You
will remember
that I remarked
the other day,
just before we
went into the
very simple
problem
presented by
Miss Mary
Sutherland,
that for
strange effects
and
extraordinary
combinations we
must go to life
itself, which
is always far
more daring
than any effort
of the
imagination.”
“A proposition
which I took
the liberty of
doubting.” “You
did, Doctor,
but none the
less you must
come round to
my view, for
otherwise I
shall keep on
piling fact
upon fact on
you until your
reason breaks
down under them
and
acknowledges me
to be right.
Now, Mr. Jabez
Wilson here has
been good
enough to call
upon me this
morning, and to
begin a
narrative which
promises to be
one of the most
singular which
I have listened
to for some
time. You have
heard me remark
that the
strangest and
most unique
things are very
often connected
not with the
larger but with
the smaller
crimes, and
occasionally,
indeed, where
there is room
for doubt
whether any
positive crime
has been
committed. As
far as I have
heard, it is
impossible for
me to say
whether the
present case is
an instance of
crime or not,
but the course
of events is
certainly among
the most
singular that I
have ever
listened to.
Perhaps, Mr.
Wilson, you
would have the
great kindness
to recommence
your narrative.
I ask you not
merely because
my friend Dr.
Watson has not
heard the
opening part
but also
because the
peculiar nature
of the story
makes me
anxious to have
every possible
detail from
your lips. As a
rule, when I
have heard some
slight
indication of
the course of
events, I am
able to guide
myself by the
thousands of
other similar
cases which
occur to my
memory. In the
present
instance I am
forced to admit
that the facts
are, to the
best of my
belief,
unique.” The
portly client
puffed out his
chest with an
appearance of
some little
pride and
pulled a dirty
and wrinkled
newspaper from
the inside
pocket of his
greatcoat. As
he glanced down
the
advertisement
column, with
his head thrust
forward and the
paper flattened
out upon his
knee, I took a
good look at
the man and
endeavoured,
after the
fashion of my
companion, to
read the
indications
which might be
presented by
his dress or
appearance. I
did not gain
very much,
however, by my
inspection. Our
visitor bore
every mark of
being an
average
commonplace
British
tradesman,
obese, pompous,
and slow. He
wore rather
baggy grey
shepherd’s
check trousers,
a not
over-clean
black
frock-coat,
unbuttoned in
the front, and
a drab
waistcoat with
a heavy brassy
Albert chain,
and a square
pierced bit of
metal dangling
down as an
ornament. A
frayed top-hat
and a faded
brown overcoat
with a wrinkled
velvet collar
lay upon a
chair beside
him.
Altogether,
look as I
would, there
was nothing
remarkable
about the man
save his
blazing red
head, and the
expression of
extreme chagrin
and discontent
upon his
features.
Sherlock
Holmes’ quick
eye took in my
occupation, and
he shook his
head with a
smile as he
noticed my
questioning
glances.
“Beyond the
obvious facts
that he has at
some time done
manual labour,
that he takes
snuff, that he
is a Freemason,
that he has
been in China,
and that he has
done a
considerable
amount of
writing lately,
I can deduce
nothing else.”
Mr. Jabez
Wilson started
up in his
chair, with his
forefinger upon
the paper, but
his eyes upon
my companion.
“How, in the
name of
good-fortune,
did you know
all that, Mr.
Holmes?” he
asked. “How did
you know, for
example, that I
did manual
labour. It’s as
true as gospel,
for I began as
a ship’s
carpenter.”
“Your hands, my
dear sir. Your
right hand is
quite a size
larger than
your left. You
have worked
with it, and
the muscles are
more
developed.”
“Well, the
snuff, then,
and the
Freemasonry?”
“I won’t insult
your
intelligence by
telling you how
I read that,
especially as,
rather against
the strict
rules of your
order, you use
an
arc-and-compass
breastpin.”
“Ah, of course,
I forgot that.
But the
writing?” “What
else can be
indicated by
that right cuff
so very shiny
for five
inches, and the
left one with
the smooth
patch near the
elbow where you
rest it upon
the desk?”
“Well, but
China?” “The
fish that you
have tattooed
immediately
above your
right wrist
could only have
been done in
China. I have
made a small
study of tattoo
marks and have
even
contributed to
the literature
of the subject.
That trick of
staining the
fishes’ scales
of a delicate
pink is quite
peculiar to
China. When, in
addition, I see
a Chinese coin
hanging from
your
watch-chain,
the matter
becomes even
more simple.”
Mr. Jabez
Wilson laughed
heavily. “Well,
I never!” said
he. “I thought
at first that
you had done
something
clever, but I
see that there
was nothing in
it after all.”
“I begin to
think, Watson,”
said Holmes,
“that I make a
mistake in
explaining.
‘_Omne ignotum
pro
magnifico_,’
you know, and
my poor little
reputation,
such as it is,
will suffer
shipwreck if I
am so candid.
Can you not
find the
advertisement,
Mr. Wilson?”
“Yes, I have
got it now,” he
answered with
his thick red
finger planted
halfway down
the column.
“Here it is.
This is what
began it all.
You just read
it for
yourself, sir.”
I took the
paper from him
and read as
follows: “TO
THE RED-HEADED
LEAGUE: On
account of the
bequest of the
late Ezekiah
Hopkins, of
Lebanon,
Pennsylvania,
U.S.A., there
is now another
vacancy open
which entitles
a member of the
League to a
salary of £ 4 a
week for purely
nominal
services. All
red-headed men
who are sound
in body and
mind and above
the age of
twenty-one
years, are
eligible. Apply
in person on
Monday, at
eleven o’clock,
to Duncan Ross,
at the offices
of the League,
7 Pope’s Court,
Fleet Street.”

=====

“What on earth
does this
mean?” I
ejaculated
after I had
twice read over
the
extraordinary
announcement.
Holmes chuckled
and wriggled in
his chair, as
was his habit
when in high
spirits. “It is
a little off
the beaten
track, isn’t
it?” said he.
“And now, Mr.
Wilson, off you
go at scratch
and tell us all
about yourself,
your household,
and the effect
which this
advertisement
had upon your
fortunes. You
will first make
a note, Doctor,
of the paper
and the date.”
“It is _The
Morning
Chronicle_ of
April 27, 1890.
Just two months
ago.” “Very
good. Now, Mr.
Wilson?” “Well,
it is just as I
have been
telling you,
Mr. Sherlock
Holmes,” said
Jabez Wilson,
mopping his
forehead; “I
have a small
pawnbroker’s
business at
Coburg Square,
near the City.
It’s not a very
large affair,
and of late
years it has
not done more
than just give
me a living. I
used to be able
to keep two
assistants, but
now I only keep
one; and I
would have a
job to pay him
but that he is
willing to come
for half wages
so as to learn
the business.”
“What is the
name of this
obliging
youth?” asked
Sherlock
Holmes. “His
name is Vincent
Spaulding, and
he’s not such a
youth, either.
It’s hard to
say his age. I
should not wish
a smarter
assistant, Mr.
Holmes; and I
know very well
that he could
better himself
and earn twice
what I am able
to give him.
But, after all,
if he is
satisfied, why
should I put
ideas in his
head?” “Why,
indeed? You
seem most
fortunate in
having an
_employé_ who
comes under the
full market
price. It is
not a common
experience
among employers
in this age. I
don’t know that
your assistant
is not as
remarkable as
your
advertisement.”
“Oh, he has his
faults, too,”
said Mr.
Wilson. “Never
was such a
fellow for
photography.
Snapping away
with a camera
when he ought
to be improving
his mind, and
then diving
down into the
cellar like a
rabbit into its
hole to develop
his pictures.
That is his
main fault, but
on the whole
he’s a good
worker. There’s
no vice in
him.” “He is
still with you,
I presume?”
“Yes, sir. He
and a girl of
fourteen, who
does a bit of
simple cooking
and keeps the
place
clean—that’s
all I have in
the house, for
I am a widower
and never had
any family. We
live very
quietly, sir,
the three of
us; and we keep
a roof over our
heads and pay
our debts, if
we do nothing
more. “The
first thing
that put us out
was that
advertisement.
Spaulding, he
came down into
the office just
this day eight
weeks, with
this very paper
in his hand,
and he says:
“‘I wish to the
Lord, Mr.
Wilson, that I
was a
red-headed
man.’ “‘Why
that?’ I asks.
“‘Why,’ says
he, ‘here’s
another vacancy
on the League
of the
Red-headed Men.
It’s worth
quite a little
fortune to any
man who gets
it, and I
understand that
there are more
vacancies than
there are men,
so that the
trustees are at
their wits’ end
what to do with
the money. If
my hair would
only change
colour, here’s
a nice little
crib all ready
for me to step
into.’ “‘Why,
what is it,
then?’ I asked.
You see, Mr.
Holmes, I am a
very
stay-at-home
man, and as my
business came
to me instead
of my having to
go to it, I was
often weeks on
end without
putting my foot
over the
door-mat. In
that way I
didn’t know
much of what
was going on
outside, and I
was always glad
of a bit of
news. “‘Have
you never heard
of the League
of the
Red-headed
Men?’ he asked
with his eyes
open. “‘Never.’
“‘Why, I wonder
at that, for
you are
eligible
yourself for
one of the
vacancies.’
“‘And what are
they worth?’ I
asked. “‘Oh,
merely a couple
of hundred a
year, but the
work is slight,
and it need not
interfere very
much with one’s
other
occupations.’
“Well, you can
easily think
that that made
me prick up my
ears, for the
business has
not been over
good for some
years, and an
extra couple of
hundred would
have been very
handy. “‘Tell
me all about
it,’ said I.
“‘Well,’ said
he, showing me
the
advertisement,
‘you can see
for yourself
that the League
has a vacancy,
and there is
the address
where you
should apply
for
particulars. As
far as I can
make out, the
League was
founded by an
American
millionaire,
Ezekiah
Hopkins, who
was very
peculiar in his
ways. He was
himself
red-headed, and
he had a great
sympathy for
all red-headed
men; so, when
he died, it was
found that he
had left his
enormous
fortune in the
hands of
trustees, with
instructions to
apply the
interest to the
providing of
easy berths to
men whose hair
is of that
colour. From
all I hear it
is splendid pay
and very little
to do.’ “‘But,’
said I, ‘there
would be
millions of
red-headed men
who would
apply.’ “‘Not
so many as you
might think,’
he answered.
‘You see it is
really confined
to Londoners,
and to grown
men. This
American had
started from
London when he
was young, and
he wanted to do
the old town a
good turn.
Then, again, I
have heard it
is no use your
applying if
your hair is
light red, or
dark red, or
anything but
real bright,
blazing, fiery
red. Now, if
you cared to
apply, Mr.
Wilson, you
would just walk
in; but perhaps
it would hardly
be worth your
while to put
yourself out of
the way for the
sake of a few
hundred
pounds.’ “Now,
it is a fact,
gentlemen, as
you may see for
yourselves,
that my hair is
of a very full
and rich tint,
so that it
seemed to me
that if there
was to be any
competition in
the matter I
stood as good a
chance as any
man that I had
ever met.
Vincent
Spaulding
seemed to know
so much about
it that I
thought he
might prove
useful, so I
just ordered
him to put up
the shutters
for the day and
to come right
away with me.
He was very
willing to have
a holiday, so
we shut the
business up and
started off for
the address
that was given
us in the
advertisement.
“I never hope
to see such a
sight as that
again, Mr.
Holmes. From
north, south,
east, and west
every man who
had a shade of
red in his hair
had tramped
into the city
to answer the
advertisement.
Fleet Street
was choked with
red-headed
folk, and
Pope’s Court
looked like a
coster’s orange
barrow. I
should not have
thought there
were so many in
the whole
country as were
brought
together by
that single
advertisement.
Every shade of
colour they
were—straw,
lemon, orange,
brick,
Irish-setter,
liver, clay;
but, as
Spaulding said,
there were not
many who had
the real vivid
flame-coloured
tint. When I
saw how many
were waiting, I
would have
given it up in
despair; but
Spaulding would
not hear of it.
How he did it I
could not
imagine, but he
pushed and
pulled and
butted until he
got me through
the crowd, and
right up to the
steps which led
to the office.
There was a
double stream
upon the stair,
some going up
in hope, and
some coming
back dejected;
but we wedged
in as well as
we could and
soon found
ourselves in
the office.”
“Your
experience has
been a most
entertaining
one,” remarked
Holmes as his
client paused
and refreshed
his memory with
a huge pinch of
snuff. “Pray
continue your
very
interesting
statement.”
“There was
nothing in the
office but a
couple of
wooden chairs
and a deal
table, behind
which sat a
small man with
a head that was
even redder
than mine. He
said a few
words to each
candidate as he
came up, and
then he always
managed to find
some fault in
them which
would
disqualify
them. Getting a
vacancy did not
seem to be such
a very easy
matter, after
all. However,
when our turn
came the little
man was much
more favourable
to me than to
any of the
others, and he
closed the door
as we entered,
so that he
might have a
private word
with us. “‘This
is Mr. Jabez
Wilson,’ said
my assistant,
‘and he is
willing to fill
a vacancy in
the League.’
“‘And he is
admirably
suited for it,’
the other
answered. ‘He
has every
requirement. I
cannot recall
when I have
seen anything
so fine.’ He
took a step
backward,
cocked his head
on one side,
and gazed at my
hair until I
felt quite
bashful. Then
suddenly he
plunged
forward, wrung
my hand, and
congratulated
me warmly on my
success. “‘It
would be
injustice to
hesitate,’ said
he. ‘You will,
however, I am
sure, excuse me
for taking an
obvious
precaution.’
With that he
seized my hair
in both his
hands, and
tugged until I
yelled with the
pain. ‘There is
water in your
eyes,’ said he
as he released
me. ‘I perceive
that all is as
it should be.
But we have to
be careful, for
we have twice
been deceived
by wigs and
once by paint.
I could tell
you tales of
cobbler’s wax
which would
disgust you
with human
nature.’ He
stepped over to
the window and
shouted through
it at the top
of his voice
that the
vacancy was
filled. A groan
of
disappointment
came up from
below, and the
folk all
trooped away in
different
directions
until there was
not a red-head
to be seen
except my own
and that of the
manager. “‘My
name,’ said he,
‘is Mr. Duncan
Ross, and I am
myself one of
the pensioners
upon the fund
left by our
noble
benefactor. Are
you a married
man, Mr.
Wilson? Have
you a family?’
“I answered
that I had not.
“His face fell
immediately.
“‘Dear me!’ he
said gravely,
‘that is very
serious indeed!
I am sorry to
hear you say
that. The fund
was, of course,
for the
propagation and
spread of the
red-heads as
well as for
their
maintenance. It
is exceedingly
unfortunate
that you should
be a bachelor.’
“My face
lengthened at
this, Mr.
Holmes, for I
thought that I
was not to have
the vacancy
after all; but
after thinking
it over for a
few minutes he
said that it
would be all
right. “‘In the
case of
another,’ said
he, ‘the
objection might
be fatal, but
we must stretch
a point in
favour of a man
with such a
head of hair as
yours. When
shall you be
able to enter
upon your new
duties?’
“‘Well, it is a
little awkward,
for I have a
business
already,’ said
I. “‘Oh, never
mind about
that, Mr.
Wilson!’ said
Vincent
Spaulding. ‘I
should be able
to look after
that for you.’
“‘What would be
the hours?’ I
asked. “‘Ten to
two.’ “Now a
pawnbroker’s
business is
mostly done of
an evening, Mr.
Holmes,
especially
Thursday and
Friday evening,
which is just
before pay-day;
so it would
suit me very
well to earn a
little in the
mornings.
Besides, I knew
that my
assistant was a
good man, and
that he would
see to anything
that turned up.
“‘That would
suit me very
well,’ said I.
‘And the pay?’
“‘Is £ 4 a
week.’ “‘And
the work?’ “‘Is
purely
nominal.’
“‘What do you
call purely
nominal?’
“‘Well, you
have to be in
the office, or
at least in the
building, the
whole time. If
you leave, you
forfeit your
whole position
forever. The
will is very
clear upon that
point. You
don’t comply
with the
conditions if
you budge from
the office
during that
time.’ “‘It’s
only four hours
a day, and I
should not
think of
leaving,’ said
I. “‘No excuse
will avail,’
said Mr. Duncan
Ross; ‘neither
sickness nor
business nor
anything else.
There you must
stay, or you
lose your
billet.’ “‘And
the work?’ “‘Is
to copy out the
_Encyclopædia
Britannica_.
There is the
first volume of
it in that
press. You must
find your own
ink, pens, and
blotting-paper,
but we provide
this table and
chair. Will you
be ready
to-morrow?’
“‘Certainly,’ I
answered.
“‘Then,
good-bye, Mr.
Jabez Wilson,
and let me
congratulate
you once more
on the
important
position which
you have been
fortunate
enough to
gain.’ He bowed
me out of the
room and I went
home with my
assistant,
hardly knowing
what to say or
do, I was so
pleased at my
own good
fortune. “Well,
I thought over
the matter all
day, and by
evening I was
in low spirits
again; for I
had quite
persuaded
myself that the
whole affair
must be some
great hoax or
fraud, though
what its object
might be I
could not
imagine. It
seemed
altogether past
belief that
anyone could
make such a
will, or that
they would pay
such a sum for
doing anything
so simple as
copying out the
_Encyclopædia
Britannica_.
Vincent
Spaulding did
what he could
to cheer me up,
but by bedtime
I had reasoned
myself out of
the whole
thing. However,
in the morning
I determined to
have a look at
it anyhow, so I
bought a penny
bottle of ink,
and with a
quill-pen, and
seven sheets of
foolscap paper,
I started off
for Pope’s
Court. “Well,
to my surprise
and delight,
everything was
as right as
possible. The
table was set
out ready for
me, and Mr.
Duncan Ross was
there to see
that I got
fairly to work.
He started me
off upon the
letter A, and
then he left
me; but he
would drop in
from time to
time to see
that all was
right with me.
At two o’clock
he bade me
good-day,
complimented me
upon the amount
that I had
written, and
locked the door
of the office
after me. “This
went on day
after day, Mr.
Holmes, and on
Saturday the
manager came in
and planked
down four
golden
sovereigns for
my week’s work.
It was the same
next week, and
the same the
week after.
Every morning I
was there at
ten, and every
afternoon I
left at two. By
degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross
took to coming
in only once of
a morning, and
then, after a
time, he did
not come in at
all. Still, of
course, I never
dared to leave
the room for an
instant, for I
was not sure
when he might
come, and the
billet was such
a good one, and
suited me so
well, that I
would not risk
the loss of it.
“Eight weeks
passed away
like this, and
I had written
about Abbots
and Archery and
Armour and
Architecture
and Attica, and
hoped with
diligence that
I might get on
to the B’s
before very
long. It cost
me something in
foolscap, and I
had pretty
nearly filled a
shelf with my
writings. And
then suddenly
the whole
business came
to an end.” “To
an end?” “Yes,
sir. And no
later than this
morning. I went
to my work as
usual at ten
o’clock, but
the door was
shut and
locked, with a
little square
of cardboard
hammered on to
the middle of
the panel with
a tack. Here it
is, and you can
read for
yourself.” He
held up a piece
of white
cardboard about
the size of a
sheet of
note-paper. It
read in this
fashion: “THE
RED-HEADED
LEAGUE IS
DISSOLVED.
October 9,
1890.”

=====

The Lord St.
Simon marriage,
and its curious
termination,
have long
ceased to be a
subject of
interest in
those exalted
circles in
which the
unfortunate
bridegroom
moves. Fresh
scandals have
eclipsed it,
and their more
piquant details
have drawn the
gossips away
from this
four-year-old
drama. As I
have reason to
believe,
however, that
the full facts
have never been
revealed to the
general public,
and as my
friend Sherlock
Holmes had a
considerable
share in
clearing the
matter up, I
feel that no
memoir of him
would be
complete
without some
little sketch
of this
remarkable
episode. It was
a few weeks
before my own
marriage,
during the days
when I was
still sharing
rooms with
Holmes in Baker
Street, that he
came home from
an afternoon
stroll to find
a letter on the
table waiting
for him. I had
remained
indoors all
day, for the
weather had
taken a sudden
turn to rain,
with high
autumnal winds,
and the jezail
bullet which I
had brought
back in one of
my limbs as a
relic of my
Afghan campaign
throbbed with
dull
persistence.
With my body in
one easy-chair
and my legs
upon another, I
had surrounded
myself with a
cloud of
newspapers
until at last,
saturated with
the news of the
day, I tossed
them all aside
and lay
listless,
watching the
huge crest and
monogram upon
the envelope
upon the table
and wondering
lazily who my
friend’s noble
correspondent
could be. “Here
is a very
fashionable
epistle,” I
remarked as he
entered. “Your
morning
letters, if I
remember right,
were from a
fish-monger and
a tide-waiter.”
“Yes, my
correspondence
has certainly
the charm of
variety,” he
answered,
smiling, “and
the humbler are
usually the
more
interesting.
This looks like
one of those
unwelcome
social
summonses which
call upon a man
either to be
bored or to
lie.” He broke
the seal and
glanced over
the contents.
“Oh, come, it
may prove to be
something of
interest, after
all.” “Not
social, then?”
“No, distinctly
professional.”
“And from a
noble client?”
“One of the
highest in
England.” “My
dear fellow, I
congratulate
you.” “I assure
you, Watson,
without
affectation,
that the status
of my client is
a matter of
less moment to
me than the
interest of his
case. It is
just possible,
however, that
that also may
not be wanting
in this new
investigation.
You have been
reading the
papers
diligently of
late, have you
not?” “It looks
like it,” said
I ruefully,
pointing to a
huge bundle in
the corner. “I
have had
nothing else to
do.” “It is
fortunate, for
you will
perhaps be able
to post me up.
I read nothing
except the
criminal news
and the agony
column. The
latter is
always
instructive.
But if you have
followed recent
events so
closely you
must have read
about Lord St.
Simon and his
wedding?” “Oh,
yes, with the
deepest
interest.”
“That is well.
The letter
which I hold in
my hand is from
Lord St. Simon.
I will read it
to you, and in
return you must
turn over these
papers and let
me have
whatever bears
upon the
matter. This is
what he says:
“‘MY DEAR MR.
SHERLOCK
HOLMES,—Lord
Backwater tells
me that I may
place implicit
reliance upon
your judgment
and discretion.
I have
determined,
therefore, to
call upon you
and to consult
you in
reference to
the very
painful event
which has
occurred in
connection with
my wedding. Mr.
Lestrade, of
Scotland Yard,
is acting
already in the
matter, but he
assures me that
he sees no
objection to
your
co-operation,
and that he
even thinks
that it might
be of some
assistance. I
will call at
four o’clock in
the afternoon,
and, should you
have any other
engagement at
that time, I
hope that you
will postpone
it, as this
matter is of
paramount
importance.
Yours
faithfully,

=====

“That is the
letter which I
have just
received, Mr.
Holmes, and my
mind is made up
that I will
accept it. I
thought,
however, that
before taking
the final step
I should like
to submit the
whole matter to
your
consideration.”
“Well, Miss
Hunter, if your
mind is made
up, that
settles the
question,” said
Holmes,
smiling. “But
you would not
advise me to
refuse?” “I
confess that it
is not the
situation which
I should like
to see a sister
of mine apply
for.” “What is
the meaning of
it all, Mr.
Holmes?” “Ah, I
have no data. I
cannot tell.
Perhaps you
have yourself
formed some
opinion?”
“Well, there
seems to me to
be only one
possible
solution. Mr.
Rucastle seemed
to be a very
kind,
good-natured
man. Is it not
possible that
his wife is a
lunatic, that
he desires to
keep the matter
quiet for fear
she should be
taken to an
asylum, and
that he humours
her fancies in
every way in
order to
prevent an
outbreak?”
“That is a
possible
solution—in
fact, as
matters stand,
it is the most
probable one.
But in any case
it does not
seem to be a
nice household
for a young
lady.” “But the
money, Mr.
Holmes, the
money!” “Well,
yes, of course
the pay is
good—too good.
That is what
makes me
uneasy. Why
should they
give you £ 120
a year, when
they could have
their pick for
£ 40? There
must be some
strong reason
behind.” “I
thought that if
I told you the
circumstances
you would
understand
afterwards if I
wanted your
help. I should
feel so much
stronger if I
felt that you
were at the
back of me.”
“Oh, you may
carry that
feeling away
with you. I
assure you that
your little
problem
promises to be
the most
interesting
which has come
my way for some
months. There
is something
distinctly
novel about
some of the
features. If
you should find
yourself in
doubt or in
danger—”
“Danger! What
danger do you
foresee?”
Holmes shook
his head
gravely. “It
would cease to
be a danger if
we could define
it,” said he.
“But at any
time, day or
night, a
telegram would
bring me down
to your help.”
“That is
enough.” She
rose briskly
from her chair
with the
anxiety all
swept from her
face. “I shall
go down to
Hampshire quite
easy in my mind
now. I shall
write to Mr.
Rucastle at
once, sacrifice
my poor hair
to-night, and
start for
Winchester
to-morrow.”
With a few
grateful words
to Holmes she
bade us both
good-night and
bustled off
upon her way.
“At least,”
said I as we
heard her
quick, firm
steps
descending the
stairs, “she
seems to be a
young lady who
is very well
able to take
care of
herself.” “And
she would need
to be,” said
Holmes gravely.
“I am much
mistaken if we
do not hear
from her before
many days are
past.” It was
not very long
before my
friend’s
prediction was
fulfilled. A
fortnight went
by, during
which I
frequently
found my
thoughts
turning in her
direction and
wondering what
strange
side-alley of
human
experience this
lonely woman
had strayed
into. The
unusual salary,
the curious
conditions, the
light duties,
all pointed to
something
abnormal,
though whether
a fad or a
plot, or
whether the man
were a
philanthropist
or a villain,
it was quite
beyond my
powers to
determine. As
to Holmes, I
observed that
he sat
frequently for
half an hour on
end, with
knitted brows
and an
abstracted air,
but he swept
the matter away
with a wave of
his hand when I
mentioned it.
“Data! data!
data!” he cried
impatiently. “I
can’t make
bricks without
clay.” And yet
he would always
wind up by
muttering that
no sister of
his should ever
have accepted
such a
situation. The
telegram which
we eventually
received came
late one night
just as I was
thinking of
turning in and
Holmes was
settling down
to one of those
all-night
chemical
researches
which he
frequently
indulged in,
when I would
leave him
stooping over a
retort and a
test-tube at
night and find
him in the same
position when I
came down to
breakfast in
the morning. He
opened the
yellow
envelope, and
then, glancing
at the message,
threw it across
to me. “Just
look up the
trains in
Bradshaw,” said
he, and turned
back to his
chemical
studies. The
summons was a
brief and
urgent one.
“Please be at
the Black Swan
Hotel at
Winchester at
midday
to-morrow,” it
said. “Do come!
I am at my
wit’s end.

=====

These
reflections
have dispelled
the agitation
with which I
began my
letter, and I
feel my heart
glow with an
enthusiasm
which elevates
me to heaven,
for nothing
contributes so
much to
tranquillise
the mind as a
steady
purpose—a point
on which the
soul may fix
its
intellectual
eye. This
expedition has
been the
favourite dream
of my early
years. I have
read with
ardour the
accounts of the
various voyages
which have been
made in the
prospect of
arriving at the
North Pacific
Ocean through
the seas which
surround the
pole. You may
remember that a
history of all
the voyages
made for
purposes of
discovery
composed the
whole of our
good Uncle
Thomas’
library. My
education was
neglected, yet
I was
passionately
fond of
reading. These
volumes were my
study day and
night, and my
familiarity
with them
increased that
regret which I
had felt, as a
child, on
learning that
my father’s
dying
injunction had
forbidden my
uncle to allow
me to embark in
a seafaring
life.

=====

These visions
faded when I
perused, for
the first time,
those poets
whose effusions
entranced my
soul and lifted
it to heaven. I
also became a
poet and for
one year lived
in a paradise
of my own
creation; I
imagined that I
also might
obtain a niche
in the temple
where the names
of Homer and
Shakespeare are
consecrated.
You are well
acquainted with
my failure and
how heavily I
bore the
disappointment.
But just at
that time I
inherited the
fortune of my
cousin, and my
thoughts were
turned into the
channel of
their earlier
bent.

=====

Six years have
passed since I
resolved on my
present
undertaking. I
can, even now,
remember the
hour from which
I dedicated
myself to this
great
enterprise. I
commenced by
inuring my body
to hardship. I
accompanied the
whale-fishers
on several
expeditions to
the North Sea;
I voluntarily
endured cold,
famine, thirst,
and want of
sleep; I often
worked harder
than the common
sailors during
the day and
devoted my
nights to the
study of
mathematics,
the theory of
medicine, and
those branches
of physical
science from
which a naval
adventurer
might derive
the greatest
practical
advantage.
Twice I
actually hired
myself as an
under-mate in a
Greenland
whaler, and
acquitted
myself to
admiration. I
must own I felt
a little proud
when my captain
offered me the
second dignity
in the vessel
and entreated
me to remain
with the
greatest
earnestness, so
valuable did he
consider my
services.

=====

And now, dear
Margaret, do I
not deserve to
accomplish some
great purpose?
My life might
have been
passed in ease
and luxury, but
I preferred
glory to every
enticement that
wealth placed
in my path. Oh,
that some
encouraging
voice would
answer in the
affirmative! My
courage and my
resolution is
firm; but my
hopes
fluctuate, and
my spirits are
often
depressed. I am
about to
proceed on a
long and
difficult
voyage, the
emergencies of
which will
demand all my
fortitude: I am
required not
only to raise
the spirits of
others, but
sometimes to
sustain my own,
when theirs are
failing.

=====

This is the
most favourable
period for
travelling in
Russia. They
fly quickly
over the snow
in their
sledges; the
motion is
pleasant, and,
in my opinion,
far more
agreeable than
that of an
English
stagecoach. The
cold is not
excessive, if
you are wrapped
in furs—a dress
which I have
already
adopted, for
there is a
great
difference
between walking
the deck and
remaining
seated
motionless for
hours, when no
exercise
prevents the
blood from
actually
freezing in
your veins. I
have no
ambition to
lose my life on
the post-road
between St.
Petersburgh and
Archangel.

=====

I shall depart
for the latter
town in a
fortnight or
three weeks;
and my
intention is to
hire a ship
there, which
can easily be
done by paying
the insurance
for the owner,
and to engage
as many sailors
as I think
necessary among
those who are
accustomed to
the
whale-fishing.
I do not intend
to sail until
the month of
June; and when
shall I return?
Ah, dear
sister, how can
I answer this
question? If I
succeed, many,
many months,
perhaps years,
will pass
before you and
I may meet. If
I fail, you
will see me
again soon, or
never.

=====

But I have one
want which I
have never yet
been able to
satisfy, and
the absence of
the object of
which I now
feel as a most
severe evil, I
have no friend,
Margaret: when
I am glowing
with the
enthusiasm of
success, there
will be none to
participate my
joy; if I am
assailed by
disappointment,
no one will
endeavour to
sustain me in
dejection. I
shall commit my
thoughts to
paper, it is
true; but that
is a poor
medium for the
communication
of feeling. I
desire the
company of a
man who could
sympathise with
me, whose eyes
would reply to
mine. You may
deem me
romantic, my
dear sister,
but I bitterly
feel the want
of a friend. I
have no one
near me, gentle
yet courageous,
possessed of a
cultivated as
well as of a
capacious mind,
whose tastes
are like my
own, to approve
or amend my
plans. How
would such a
friend repair
the faults of
your poor
brother! I am
too ardent in
execution and
too impatient
of
difficulties.
But it is a
still greater
evil to me that
I am
self-educated:
for the first
fourteen years
of my life I
ran wild on a
common and read
nothing but our
Uncle Thomas’
books of
voyages. At
that age I
became
acquainted with
the celebrated
poets of our
own country;
but it was only
when it had
ceased to be in
my power to
derive its most
important
benefits from
such a
conviction that
I perceived the
necessity of
becoming
acquainted with
more languages
than that of my
native country.
Now I am
twenty-eight
and am in
reality more
illiterate than
many schoolboys
of fifteen. It
is true that I
have thought
more and that
my daydreams
are more
extended and
magnificent,
but they want
(as the
painters call
it) _keeping;_
and I greatly
need a friend
who would have
sense enough
not to despise
me as romantic,
and affection
enough for me
to endeavour to
regulate my
mind.

=====

The master is a
person of an
excellent
disposition and
is remarkable
in the ship for
his gentleness
and the
mildness of his
discipline.
This
circumstance,
added to his
well-known
integrity and
dauntless
courage, made
me very
desirous to
engage him. A
youth passed in
solitude, my
best years
spent under
your gentle and
feminine
fosterage, has
so refined the
groundwork of
my character
that I cannot
overcome an
intense
distaste to the
usual brutality
exercised on
board ship: I
have never
believed it to
be necessary,
and when I
heard of a
mariner equally
noted for his
kindliness of
heart and the
respect and
obedience paid
to him by his
crew, I felt
myself
peculiarly
fortunate in
being able to
secure his
services. I
heard of him
first in rather
a romantic
manner, from a
lady who owes
to him the
happiness of
her life. This,
briefly, is his
story. Some
years ago he
loved a young
Russian lady of
moderate
fortune, and
having amassed
a considerable
sum in
prize-money,
the father of
the girl
consented to
the match. He
saw his
mistress once
before the
destined
ceremony; but
she was bathed
in tears, and
throwing
herself at his
feet, entreated
him to spare
her, confessing
at the same
time that she
loved another,
but that he was
poor, and that
her father
would never
consent to the
union. My
generous friend
reassured the
suppliant, and
on being
informed of the
name of her
lover,
instantly
abandoned his
pursuit. He had
already bought
a farm with his
money, on which
he had designed
to pass the
remainder of
his life; but
he bestowed the
whole on his
rival, together
with the
remains of his
prize-money to
purchase stock,
and then
himself
solicited the
young woman’s
father to
consent to her
marriage with
her lover. But
the old man
decidedly
refused,
thinking
himself bound
in honour to my
friend, who,
when he found
the father
inexorable,
quitted his
country, nor
returned until
he heard that
his former
mistress was
married
according to
her
inclinations.
“What a noble
fellow!” you
will exclaim.
He is so; but
then he is
wholly
uneducated: he
is as silent as
a Turk, and a
kind of
ignorant
carelessness
attends him,
which, while it
renders his
conduct the
more
astonishing,
detracts from
the interest
and sympathy
which otherwise
he would
command.

=====

Yet do not
suppose,
because I
complain a
little or
because I can
conceive a
consolation for
my toils which
I may never
know, that I am
wavering in my
resolutions.
Those are as
fixed as fate,
and my voyage
is only now
delayed until
the weather
shall permit my
embarkation.
The winter has
been dreadfully
severe, but the
spring promises
well, and it is
considered as a
remarkably
early season,
so that perhaps
I may sail
sooner than I
expected. I
shall do
nothing rashly:
you know me
sufficiently to
confide in my
prudence and
considerateness
whenever the
safety of
others is
committed to my
care.

=====

I write a few
lines in haste
to say that I
am safe—and
well advanced
on my voyage.
This letter
will reach
England by a
merchantman now
on its homeward
voyage from
Archangel; more
fortunate than
I, who may not
see my native
land, perhaps,
for many years.
I am, however,
in good
spirits: my men
are bold and
apparently firm
of purpose, nor
do the floating
sheets of ice
that
continually
pass us,
indicating the
dangers of the
region towards
which we are
advancing,
appear to
dismay them. We
have already
reached a very
high latitude;
but it is the
height of
summer, and
although not so
warm as in
England, the
southern gales,
which blow us
speedily
towards those
shores which I
so ardently
desire to
attain, breathe
a degree of
renovating
warmth which I
had not
expected.

=====

About two
o’clock the
mist cleared
away, and we
beheld,
stretched out
in every
direction, vast
and irregular
plains of ice,
which seemed to
have no end.
Some of my
comrades
groaned, and my
own mind began
to grow
watchful with
anxious
thoughts, when
a strange sight
suddenly
attracted our
attention and
diverted our
solicitude from
our own
situation. We
perceived a low
carriage, fixed
on a sledge and
drawn by dogs,
pass on towards
the north, at
the distance of
half a mile; a
being which had
the shape of a
man, but
apparently of
gigantic
stature, sat in
the sledge and
guided the
dogs. We
watched the
rapid progress
of the
traveller with
our telescopes
until he was
lost among the
distant
inequalities of
the ice.

=====

In the morning,
however, as
soon as it was
light, I went
upon deck and
found all the
sailors busy on
one side of the
vessel,
apparently
talking to
someone in the
sea. It was, in
fact, a sledge,
like that we
had seen
before, which
had drifted
towards us in
the night on a
large fragment
of ice. Only
one dog
remained alive;
but there was a
human being
within it whom
the sailors
were persuading
to enter the
vessel. He was
not, as the
other traveller
seemed to be, a
savage
inhabitant of
some
undiscovered
island, but a
European. When
I appeared on
deck the master
said, “Here is
our captain,
and he will not
allow you to
perish on the
open sea.”

=====

Upon hearing
this he
appeared
satisfied and
consented to
come on board.
Good God!
Margaret, if
you had seen
the man who
thus
capitulated for
his safety,
your surprise
would have been
boundless. His
limbs were
nearly frozen,
and his body
dreadfully
emaciated by
fatigue and
suffering. I
never saw a man
in so wretched
a condition. We
attempted to
carry him into
the cabin, but
as soon as he
had quitted the
fresh air he
fainted. We
accordingly
brought him
back to the
deck and
restored him to
animation by
rubbing him
with brandy and
forcing him to
swallow a small
quantity. As
soon as he
showed signs of
life we wrapped
him up in
blankets and
placed him near
the chimney of
the kitchen
stove. By slow
degrees he
recovered and
ate a little
soup, which
restored him
wonderfully.

=====

Two days passed
in this manner
before he was
able to speak,
and I often
feared that his
sufferings had
deprived him of
understanding.
When he had in
some measure
recovered, I
removed him to
my own cabin
and attended on
him as much as
my duty would
permit. I never
saw a more
interesting
creature: his
eyes have
generally an
expression of
wildness, and
even madness,
but there are
moments when,
if anyone
performs an act
of kindness
towards him or
does him any
the most
trifling
service, his
whole
countenance is
lighted up, as
it were, with a
beam of
benevolence and
sweetness that
I never saw
equalled. But
he is generally
melancholy and
despairing, and
sometimes he
gnashes his
teeth, as if
impatient of
the weight of
woes that
oppresses him.

=====

Such is my
journal of what
relates to this
strange
occurrence up
to the present
day. The
stranger has
gradually
improved in
health but is
very silent and
appears uneasy
when anyone
except myself
enters his
cabin. Yet his
manners are so
conciliating
and gentle that
the sailors are
all interested
in him,
although they
have had very
little
communication
with him. For
my own part, I
begin to love
him as a
brother, and
his constant
and deep grief
fills me with
sympathy and
compassion. He
must have been
a noble
creature in his
better days,
being even now
in wreck so
attractive and
amiable.

=====

He is now much
recovered from
his illness and
is continually
on the deck,
apparently
watching for
the sledge that
preceded his
own. Yet,
although
unhappy, he is
not so utterly
occupied by his
own misery but
that he
interests
himself deeply
in the projects
of others. He
has frequently
conversed with
me on mine,
which I have
communicated to
him without
disguise. He
entered
attentively
into all my
arguments in
favour of my
eventual
success and
into every
minute detail
of the measures
I had taken to
secure it. I
was easily led
by the sympathy
which he
evinced to use
the language of
my heart, to
give utterance
to the burning
ardour of my
soul and to
say, with all
the fervour
that warmed me,
how gladly I
would sacrifice
my fortune, my
existence, my
every hope, to
the furtherance
of my
enterprise. One
man’s life or
death were but
a small price
to pay for the
acquirement of
the knowledge
which I sought,
for the
dominion I
should acquire
and transmit
over the
elemental foes
of our race. As
I spoke, a dark
gloom spread
over my
listener’s
countenance. At
first I
perceived that
he tried to
suppress his
emotion; he
placed his
hands before
his eyes, and
my voice
quivered and
failed me as I
beheld tears
trickle fast
from between
his fingers; a
groan burst
from his
heaving breast.
I paused; at
length he
spoke, in
broken accents:
“Unhappy man!
Do you share my
madness? Have
you drunk also
of the
intoxicating
draught? Hear
me; let me
reveal my tale,
and you will
dash the cup
from your
lips!”

=====

Having
conquered the
violence of his
feelings, he
appeared to
despise himself
for being the
slave of
passion; and
quelling the
dark tyranny of
despair, he led
me again to
converse
concerning
myself
personally. He
asked me the
history of my
earlier years.
The tale was
quickly told,
but it awakened
various trains
of reflection.
I spoke of my
desire of
finding a
friend, of my
thirst for a
more intimate
sympathy with a
fellow mind
than had ever
fallen to my
lot, and
expressed my
conviction that
a man could
boast of little
happiness who
did not enjoy
this blessing.

=====

Will you smile
at the
enthusiasm I
express
concerning this
divine
wanderer? You
would not if
you saw him.
You have been
tutored and
refined by
books and
retirement from
the world, and
you are
therefore
somewhat
fastidious; but
this only
renders you the
more fit to
appreciate the
extraordinary
merits of this
wonderful man.
Sometimes I
have
endeavoured to
discover what
quality it is
which he
possesses that
elevates him so
immeasurably
above any other
person I ever
knew. I believe
it to be an
intuitive
discernment, a
quick but
never-failing
power of
judgment, a
penetration
into the causes
of things,
unequalled for
clearness and
precision; add
to this a
facility of
expression and
a voice whose
varied
intonations are
soul-subduing
music.

=====

Yesterday the
stranger said
to me, “You may
easily
perceive,
Captain Walton,
that I have
suffered great
and
unparalleled
misfortunes. I
had determined
at one time
that the memory
of these evils
should die with
me, but you
have won me to
alter my
determination.
You seek for
knowledge and
wisdom, as I
once did; and I
ardently hope
that the
gratification
of your wishes
may not be a
serpent to
sting you, as
mine has been.
I do not know
that the
relation of my
disasters will
be useful to
you; yet, when
I reflect that
you are
pursuing the
same course,
exposing
yourself to the
same dangers
which have
rendered me
what I am, I
imagine that
you may deduce
an apt moral
from my tale,
one that may
direct you if
you succeed in
your
undertaking and
console you in
case of
failure.
Prepare to hear
of occurrences
which are
usually deemed
marvellous.
Were we among
the tamer
scenes of
nature I might
fear to
encounter your
unbelief,
perhaps your
ridicule; but
many things
will appear
possible in
these wild and
mysterious
regions which
would provoke
the laughter of
those
unacquainted
with the
ever-varied
powers of
nature; nor can
I doubt but
that my tale
conveys in its
series internal
evidence of the
truth of the
events of which
it is
composed.”

=====

He then told me
that he would
commence his
narrative the
next day when I
should be at
leisure. This
promise drew
from me the
warmest thanks.
I have resolved
every night,
when I am not
imperatively
occupied by my
duties, to
record, as
nearly as
possible in his
own words, what
he has related
during the day.
If I should be
engaged, I will
at least make
notes. This
manuscript will
doubtless
afford you the
greatest
pleasure; but
to me, who know
him, and who
hear it from
his own
lips—with what
interest and
sympathy shall
I read it in
some future
day! Even now,
as I commence
my task, his
full-toned
voice swells in
my ears; his
lustrous eyes
dwell on me
with all their
melancholy
sweetness; I
see his thin
hand raised in
animation,
while the
lineaments of
his face are
irradiated by
the soul
within. Strange
and harrowing
must be his
story,
frightful the
storm which
embraced the
gallant vessel
on its course
and wrecked
it—thus!

=====

I am by birth a
Genevese, and
my family is
one of the most
distinguished
of that
republic. My
ancestors had
been for many
years
counsellors and
syndics, and my
father had
filled several
public
situations with
honour and
reputation. He
was respected
by all who knew
him for his
integrity and
indefatigable
attention to
public
business. He
passed his
younger days
perpetually
occupied by the
affairs of his
country; a
variety of
circumstances
had prevented
his marrying
early, nor was
it until the
decline of life
that he became
a husband and
the father of a
family.

=====

As the
circumstances
of his marriage
illustrate his
character, I
cannot refrain
from relating
them. One of
his most
intimate
friends was a
merchant who,
from a
flourishing
state, fell,
through
numerous
mischances,
into poverty.
This man, whose
name was
Beaufort, was
of a proud and
unbending
disposition and
could not bear
to live in
poverty and
oblivion in the
same country
where he had
formerly been
distinguished
for his rank
and
magnificence.
Having paid his
debts,
therefore, in
the most
honourable
manner, he
retreated with
his daughter to
the town of
Lucerne, where
he lived
unknown and in
wretchedness.
My father loved
Beaufort with
the truest
friendship and
was deeply
grieved by his
retreat in
these
unfortunate
circumstances.
He bitterly
deplored the
false pride
which led his
friend to a
conduct so
little worthy
of the
affection that
united them. He
lost no time in
endeavouring to
seek him out,
with the hope
of persuading
him to begin
the world again
through his
credit and
assistance.

=====

Beaufort had
taken effectual
measures to
conceal
himself, and it
was ten months
before my
father
discovered his
abode.
Overjoyed at
this discovery,
he hastened to
the house,
which was
situated in a
mean street
near the Reuss.
But when he
entered, misery
and despair
alone welcomed
him. Beaufort
had saved but a
very small sum
of money from
the wreck of
his fortunes,
but it was
sufficient to
provide him
with sustenance
for some
months, and in
the meantime he
hoped to
procure some
respectable
employment in a
merchant’s
house. The
interval was,
consequently,
spent in
inaction; his
grief only
became more
deep and
rankling when
he had leisure
for reflection,
and at length
it took so fast
hold of his
mind that at
the end of
three months he
lay on a bed of
sickness,
incapable of
any exertion.

=====

Several months
passed in this
manner. Her
father grew
worse; her time
was more
entirely
occupied in
attending him;
her means of
subsistence
decreased; and
in the tenth
month her
father died in
her arms,
leaving her an
orphan and a
beggar. This
last blow
overcame her,
and she knelt
by Beaufort’s
coffin weeping
bitterly, when
my father
entered the
chamber. He
came like a
protecting
spirit to the
poor girl, who
committed
herself to his
care; and after
the interment
of his friend
he conducted
her to Geneva
and placed her
under the
protection of a
relation. Two
years after
this event
Caroline became
his wife.

=====

There was a
considerable
difference
between the
ages of my
parents, but
this
circumstance
seemed to unite
them only
closer in bonds
of devoted
affection.
There was a
sense of
justice in my
father’s
upright mind
which rendered
it necessary
that he should
approve highly
to love
strongly.
Perhaps during
former years he
had suffered
from the
late-discovered
unworthiness of
one beloved and
so was disposed
to set a
greater value
on tried worth.
There was a
show of
gratitude and
worship in his
attachment to
my mother,
differing
wholly from the
doting fondness
of age, for it
was inspired by
reverence for
her virtues and
a desire to be
the means of,
in some degree,
recompensing
her for the
sorrows she had
endured, but
which gave
inexpressible
grace to his
behaviour to
her. Everything
was made to
yield to her
wishes and her
convenience. He
strove to
shelter her, as
a fair exotic
is sheltered by
the gardener,
from every
rougher wind
and to surround
her with all
that could tend
to excite
pleasurable
emotion in her
soft and
benevolent
mind. Her
health, and
even the
tranquillity of
her hitherto
constant
spirit, had
been shaken by
what she had
gone through.
During the two
years that had
elapsed
previous to
their marriage
my father had
gradually
relinquished
all his public
functions; and
immediately
after their
union they
sought the
pleasant
climate of
Italy, and the
change of scene
and interest
attendant on a
tour through
that land of
wonders, as a
restorative for
her weakened
frame.

=====

From Italy they
visited Germany
and France. I,
their eldest
child, was born
at Naples, and
as an infant
accompanied
them in their
rambles. I
remained for
several years
their only
child. Much as
they were
attached to
each other,
they seemed to
draw
inexhaustible
stores of
affection from
a very mine of
love to bestow
them upon me.
My mother’s
tender caresses
and my father’s
smile of
benevolent
pleasure while
regarding me
are my first
recollections.
I was their
plaything and
their idol, and
something
better—their
child, the
innocent and
helpless
creature
bestowed on
them by Heaven,
whom to bring
up to good, and
whose future
lot it was in
their hands to
direct to
happiness or
misery,
according as
they fulfilled
their duties
towards me.
With this deep
consciousness
of what they
owed towards
the being to
which they had
given life,
added to the
active spirit
of tenderness
that animated
both, it may be
imagined that
while during
every hour of
my infant life
I received a
lesson of
patience, of
charity, and of
self-control, I
was so guided
by a silken
cord that all
seemed but one
train of
enjoyment to
me.

=====

The peasant
woman,
perceiving that
my mother fixed
eyes of wonder
and admiration
on this lovely
girl, eagerly
communicated
her history.
She was not her
child, but the
daughter of a
Milanese
nobleman. Her
mother was a
German and had
died on giving
her birth. The
infant had been
placed with
these good
people to
nurse: they
were better off
then. They had
not been long
married, and
their eldest
child was but
just born. The
father of their
charge was one
of those
Italians nursed
in the memory
of the antique
glory of
Italy—one among
the _schiavi
ognor
frementi,_ who
exerted himself
to obtain the
liberty of his
country. He
became the
victim of its
weakness.
Whether he had
died or still
lingered in the
dungeons of
Austria was not
known. His
property was
confiscated;
his child
became an
orphan and a
beggar. She
continued with
her foster
parents and
bloomed in
their rude
abode, fairer
than a garden
rose among
dark-leaved
brambles.

=====

When my father
returned from
Milan, he found
playing with me
in the hall of
our villa a
child fairer
than pictured
cherub—a
creature who
seemed to shed
radiance from
her looks and
whose form and
motions were
lighter than
the chamois of
the hills. The
apparition was
soon explained.
With his
permission my
mother
prevailed on
her rustic
guardians to
yield their
charge to her.
They were fond
of the sweet
orphan. Her
presence had
seemed a
blessing to
them, but it
would be unfair
to her to keep
her in poverty
and want when
Providence
afforded her
such powerful
protection.
They consulted
their village
priest, and the
result was that
Elizabeth
Lavenza became
the inmate of
my parents’
house—my more
than sister—the
beautiful and
adored
companion of
all my
occupations and
my pleasures.

=====

Everyone loved
Elizabeth. The
passionate and
almost
reverential
attachment with
which all
regarded her
became, while I
shared it, my
pride and my
delight. On the
evening
previous to her
being brought
to my home, my
mother had said
playfully, “I
have a pretty
present for my
Victor—tomorrow
he shall have
it.” And when,
on the morrow,
she presented
Elizabeth to me
as her promised
gift, I, with
childish
seriousness,
interpreted her
words literally
and looked upon
Elizabeth as
mine—mine to
protect, love,
and cherish.
All praises
bestowed on her
I received as
made to a
possession of
my own. We
called each
other
familiarly by
the name of
cousin. No
word, no
expression
could body
forth the kind
of relation in
which she stood
to me—my more
than sister,
since till
death she was
to be mine
only.

=====

We were brought
up together;
there was not
quite a year
difference in
our ages. I
need not say
that we were
strangers to
any species of
disunion or
dispute.
Harmony was the
soul of our
companionship,
and the
diversity and
contrast that
subsisted in
our characters
drew us nearer
together.
Elizabeth was
of a calmer and
more
concentrated
disposition;
but, with all
my ardour, I
was capable of
a more intense
application and
was more deeply
smitten with
the thirst for
knowledge. She
busied herself
with following
the aerial
creations of
the poets; and
in the majestic
and wondrous
scenes which
surrounded our
Swiss home —the
sublime shapes
of the
mountains, the
changes of the
seasons,
tempest and
calm, the
silence of
winter, and the
life and
turbulence of
our Alpine
summers—she
found ample
scope for
admiration and
delight. While
my companion
contemplated
with a serious
and satisfied
spirit the
magnificent
appearances of
things, I
delighted in
investigating
their causes.
The world was
to me a secret
which I desired
to divine.
Curiosity,
earnest
research to
learn the
hidden laws of
nature,
gladness akin
to rapture, as
they were
unfolded to me,
are among the
earliest
sensations I
can remember.

=====

On the birth of
a second son,
my junior by
seven years, my
parents gave up
entirely their
wandering life
and fixed
themselves in
their native
country. We
possessed a
house in
Geneva, and a
_campagne_ on
Belrive, the
eastern shore
of the lake, at
the distance of
rather more
than a league
from the city.
We resided
principally in
the latter, and
the lives of my
parents were
passed in
considerable
seclusion. It
was my temper
to avoid a
crowd and to
attach myself
fervently to a
few. I was
indifferent,
therefore, to
my
school-fellows
in general; but
I united myself
in the bonds of
the closest
friendship to
one among them.
Henry Clerval
was the son of
a merchant of
Geneva. He was
a boy of
singular talent
and fancy. He
loved
enterprise,
hardship, and
even danger for
its own sake.
He was deeply
read in books
of chivalry and
romance. He
composed heroic
songs and began
to write many a
tale of
enchantment and
knightly
adventure. He
tried to make
us act plays
and to enter
into
masquerades, in
which the
characters were
drawn from the
heroes of
Roncesvalles,
of the Round
Table of King
Arthur, and the
chivalrous
train who shed
their blood to
redeem the holy
sepulchre from
the hands of
the infidels.

=====

I feel
exquisite
pleasure in
dwelling on the
recollections
of childhood,
before
misfortune had
tainted my mind
and changed its
bright visions
of extensive
usefulness into
gloomy and
narrow
reflections
upon self.
Besides, in
drawing the
picture of my
early days, I
also record
those events
which led, by
insensible
steps, to my
after tale of
misery, for
when I would
account to
myself for the
birth of that
passion which
afterwards
ruled my
destiny I find
it arise, like
a mountain
river, from
ignoble and
almost
forgotten
sources; but,
swelling as it
proceeded, it
became the
torrent which,
in its course,
has swept away
all my hopes
and joys.

=====

Natural
philosophy is
the genius that
has regulated
my fate; I
desire,
therefore, in
this narration,
to state those
facts which led
to my
predilection
for that
science. When I
was thirteen
years of age we
all went on a
party of
pleasure to the
baths near
Thonon; the
inclemency of
the weather
obliged us to
remain a day
confined to the
inn. In this
house I chanced
to find a
volume of the
works of
Cornelius
Agrippa. I
opened it with
apathy; the
theory which he
attempts to
demonstrate and
the wonderful
facts which he
relates soon
changed this
feeling into
enthusiasm. A
new light
seemed to dawn
upon my mind,
and bounding
with joy, I
communicated my
discovery to my
father. My
father looked
carelessly at
the title page
of my book and
said, “Ah!
Cornelius
Agrippa! My
dear Victor, do
not waste your
time upon this;
it is sad
trash.”

=====

If, instead of
this remark, my
father had
taken the pains
to explain to
me that the
principles of
Agrippa had
been entirely
exploded and
that a modern
system of
science had
been introduced
which possessed
much greater
powers than the
ancient,
because the
powers of the
latter were
chimerical,
while those of
the former were
real and
practical,
under such
circumstances I
should
certainly have
thrown Agrippa
aside and have
contented my
imagination,
warmed as it
was, by
returning with
greater ardour
to my former
studies. It is
even possible
that the train
of my ideas
would never
have received
the fatal
impulse that
led to my ruin.
But the cursory
glance my
father had
taken of my
volume by no
means assured
me that he was
acquainted with
its contents,
and I continued
to read with
the greatest
avidity.

=====

When I returned
home my first
care was to
procure the
whole works of
this author,
and afterwards
of Paracelsus
and Albertus
Magnus. I read
and studied the
wild fancies of
these writers
with delight;
they appeared
to me treasures
known to few
besides myself.
I have
described
myself as
always having
been imbued
with a fervent
longing to
penetrate the
secrets of
nature. In
spite of the
intense labour
and wonderful
discoveries of
modern
philosophers, I
always came
from my studies
discontented
and
unsatisfied.
Sir Isaac
Newton is said
to have avowed
that he felt
like a child
picking up
shells beside
the great and
unexplored
ocean of truth.
Those of his
successors in
each branch of
natural
philosophy with
whom I was
acquainted
appeared even
to my boy’s
apprehensions
as tyros
engaged in the
same pursuit.

=====

The untaught
peasant beheld
the elements
around him and
was acquainted
with their
practical uses.
The most
learned
philosopher
knew little
more. He had
partially
unveiled the
face of Nature,
but her
immortal
lineaments were
still a wonder
and a mystery.
He might
dissect,
anatomise, and
give names;
but, not to
speak of a
final cause,
causes in their
secondary and
tertiary grades
were utterly
unknown to him.
I had gazed
upon the
fortifications
and impediments
that seemed to
keep human
beings from
entering the
citadel of
nature, and
rashly and
ignorantly I
had repined.

=====

But here were
books, and here
were men who
had penetrated
deeper and knew
more. I took
their word for
all that they
averred, and I
became their
disciple. It
may appear
strange that
such should
arise in the
eighteenth
century; but
while I
followed the
routine of
education in
the schools of
Geneva, I was,
to a great
degree,
self-taught
with regard to
my favourite
studies. My
father was not
scientific, and
I was left to
struggle with a
child’s
blindness,
added to a
student’s
thirst for
knowledge.
Under the
guidance of my
new preceptors
I entered with
the greatest
diligence into
the search of
the
philosopher’s
stone and the
elixir of life;
but the latter
soon obtained
my undivided
attention.
Wealth was an
inferior
object, but
what glory
would attend
the discovery
if I could
banish disease
from the human
frame and
render man
invulnerable to
any but a
violent death!

=====

Nor were these
my only
visions. The
raising of
ghosts or
devils was a
promise
liberally
accorded by my
favourite
authors, the
fulfilment of
which I most
eagerly sought;
and if my
incantations
were always
unsuccessful, I
attributed the
failure rather
to my own
inexperience
and mistake
than to a want
of skill or
fidelity in my
instructors.
And thus for a
time I was
occupied by
exploded
systems,
mingling, like
an unadept, a
thousand
contradictory
theories and
floundering
desperately in
a very slough
of multifarious
knowledge,
guided by an
ardent
imagination and
childish
reasoning, till
an accident
again changed
the current of
my ideas.

=====

When I was
about fifteen
years old we
had retired to
our house near
Belrive, when
we witnessed a
most violent
and terrible
thunderstorm.
It advanced
from behind the
mountains of
Jura, and the
thunder burst
at once with
frightful
loudness from
various
quarters of the
heavens. I
remained, while
the storm
lasted,
watching its
progress with
curiosity and
delight. As I
stood at the
door, on a
sudden I beheld
a stream of
fire issue from
an old and
beautiful oak
which stood
about twenty
yards from our
house; and so
soon as the
dazzling light
vanished, the
oak had
disappeared,
and nothing
remained but a
blasted stump.
When we visited
it the next
morning, we
found the tree
shattered in a
singular
manner. It was
not splintered
by the shock,
but entirely
reduced to thin
ribbons of
wood. I never
beheld anything
so utterly
destroyed.

=====

Before this I
was not
unacquainted
with the more
obvious laws of
electricity. On
this occasion a
man of great
research in
natural
philosophy was
with us, and
excited by this
catastrophe, he
entered on the
explanation of
a theory which
he had formed
on the subject
of electricity
and galvanism,
which was at
once new and
astonishing to
me. All that he
said threw
greatly into
the shade
Cornelius
Agrippa,
Albertus
Magnus, and
Paracelsus, the
lords of my
imagination;
but by some
fatality the
overthrow of
these men
disinclined me
to pursue my
accustomed
studies. It
seemed to me as
if nothing
would or could
ever be known.
All that had so
long engaged my
attention
suddenly grew
despicable. By
one of those
caprices of the
mind which we
are perhaps
most subject to
in early youth,
I at once gave
up my former
occupations,
set down
natural history
and all its
progeny as a
deformed and
abortive
creation, and
entertained the
greatest
disdain for a
would-be
science which
could never
even step
within the
threshold of
real knowledge.
In this mood of
mind I betook
myself to the
mathematics and
the branches of
study
appertaining to
that science as
being built
upon secure
foundations,
and so worthy
of my
consideration.

=====

Thus strangely
are our souls
constructed,
and by such
slight
ligaments are
we bound to
prosperity or
ruin. When I
look back, it
seems to me as
if this almost
miraculous
change of
inclination and
will was the
immediate
suggestion of
the guardian
angel of my
life—the last
effort made by
the spirit of
preservation to
avert the storm
that was even
then hanging in
the stars and
ready to
envelop me. Her
victory was
announced by an
unusual
tranquillity
and gladness of
soul which
followed the
relinquishing
of my ancient
and latterly
tormenting
studies. It was
thus that I was
to be taught to
associate evil
with their
prosecution,
happiness with
their
disregard.

=====

When I had
attained the
age of
seventeen my
parents
resolved that I
should become a
student at the
university of
Ingolstadt. I
had hitherto
attended the
schools of
Geneva, but my
father thought
it necessary
for the
completion of
my education
that I should
be made
acquainted with
other customs
than those of
my native
country. My
departure was
therefore fixed
at an early
date, but
before the day
resolved upon
could arrive,
the first
misfortune of
my life
occurred—an
omen, as it
were, of my
future misery.

=====

She died
calmly, and her
countenance
expressed
affection even
in death. I
need not
describe the
feelings of
those whose
dearest ties
are rent by
that most
irreparable
evil, the void
that presents
itself to the
soul, and the
despair that is
exhibited on
the
countenance. It
is so long
before the mind
can persuade
itself that she
whom we saw
every day and
whose very
existence
appeared a part
of our own can
have departed
for ever—that
the brightness
of a beloved
eye can have
been
extinguished
and the sound
of a voice so
familiar and
dear to the ear
can be hushed,
never more to
be heard. These
are the
reflections of
the first days;
but when the
lapse of time
proves the
reality of the
evil, then the
actual
bitterness of
grief
commences. Yet
from whom has
not that rude
hand rent away
some dear
connection? And
why should I
describe a
sorrow which
all have felt,
and must feel?
The time at
length arrives
when grief is
rather an
indulgence than
a necessity;
and the smile
that plays upon
the lips,
although it may
be deemed a
sacrilege, is
not banished.
My mother was
dead, but we
had still
duties which we
ought to
perform; we
must continue
our course with
the rest and
learn to think
ourselves
fortunate
whilst one
remains whom
the spoiler has
not seized.

=====

The day of my
departure at
length arrived.
Clerval spent
the last
evening with
us. He had
endeavoured to
persuade his
father to
permit him to
accompany me
and to become
my fellow
student, but in
vain. His
father was a
narrow-minded
trader and saw
idleness and
ruin in the
aspirations and
ambition of his
son. Henry
deeply felt the
misfortune of
being debarred
from a liberal
education. He
said little,
but when he
spoke I read in
his kindling
eye and in his
animated glance
a restrained
but firm
resolve not to
be chained to
the miserable
details of
commerce.

=====

We sat late. We
could not tear
ourselves away
from each other
nor persuade
ourselves to
say the word
“Farewell!” It
was said, and
we retired
under the
pretence of
seeking repose,
each fancying
that the other
was deceived;
but when at
morning’s dawn
I descended to
the carriage
which was to
convey me away,
they were all
there—my father
again to bless
me, Clerval to
press my hand
once more, my
Elizabeth to
renew her
entreaties that
I would write
often and to
bestow the last
feminine
attentions on
her playmate
and friend.

=====

I threw myself
into the chaise
that was to
convey me away
and indulged in
the most
melancholy
reflections. I,
who had ever
been surrounded
by amiable
companions,
continually
engaged in
endeavouring to
bestow mutual
pleasure—I was
now alone. In
the university
whither I was
going I must
form my own
friends and be
my own
protector. My
life had
hitherto been
remarkably
secluded and
domestic, and
this had given
me invincible
repugnance to
new
countenances. I
loved my
brothers,
Elizabeth, and
Clerval; these
were “old
familiar
faces,” but I
believed myself
totally
unfitted for
the company of
strangers. Such
were my
reflections as
I commenced my
journey; but as
I proceeded, my
spirits and
hopes rose. I
ardently
desired the
acquisition of
knowledge. I
had often, when
at home,
thought it hard
to remain
during my youth
cooped up in
one place and
had longed to
enter the world
and take my
station among
other human
beings. Now my
desires were
complied with,
and it would,
indeed, have
been folly to
repent.

=====

The next
morning I
delivered my
letters of
introduction
and paid a
visit to some
of the
principal
professors.
Chance—or
rather the evil
influence, the
Angel of
Destruction,
which asserted
omnipotent sway
over me from
the moment I
turned my
reluctant steps
from my
father’s
door—led me
first to M.
Krempe,
professor of
natural
philosophy. He
was an uncouth
man, but deeply
imbued in the
secrets of his
science. He
asked me
several
questions
concerning my
progress in the
different
branches of
science
appertaining to
natural
philosophy. I
replied
carelessly, and
partly in
contempt,
mentioned the
names of my
alchemists as
the principal
authors I had
studied. The
professor
stared. “Have
you,” he said,
“really spent
your time in
studying such
nonsense?”

=====

I replied in
the
affirmative.
“Every minute,”
continued M.
Krempe with
warmth, “every
instant that
you have wasted
on those books
is utterly and
entirely lost.
You have
burdened your
memory with
exploded
systems and
useless names.
Good God! In
what desert
land have you
lived, where no
one was kind
enough to
inform you that
these fancies
which you have
so greedily
imbibed are a
thousand years
old and as
musty as they
are ancient? I
little
expected, in
this
enlightened and
scientific age,
to find a
disciple of
Albertus Magnus
and Paracelsus.
My dear sir,
you must begin
your studies
entirely anew.”

=====

I returned home
not
disappointed,
for I have said
that I had long
considered
those authors
useless whom
the professor
reprobated; but
I returned not
at all the more
inclined to
recur to these
studies in any
shape. M.
Krempe was a
little squat
man with a
gruff voice and
a repulsive
countenance;
the teacher,
therefore, did
not prepossess
me in favour of
his pursuits.
In rather a too
philosophical
and connected a
strain,
perhaps, I have
given an
account of the
conclusions I
had come to
concerning them
in my early
years. As a
child I had not
been content
with the
results
promised by the
modern
professors of
natural
science. With a
confusion of
ideas only to
be accounted
for by my
extreme youth
and my want of
a guide on such
matters, I had
retrod the
steps of
knowledge along
the paths of
time and
exchanged the
discoveries of
recent
inquirers for
the dreams of
forgotten
alchemists.
Besides, I had
a contempt for
the uses of
modern natural
philosophy. It
was very
different when
the masters of
the science
sought
immortality and
power; such
views, although
futile, were
grand; but now
the scene was
changed. The
ambition of the
inquirer seemed
to limit itself
to the
annihilation of
those visions
on which my
interest in
science was
chiefly
founded. I was
required to
exchange
chimeras of
boundless
grandeur for
realities of
little worth.

=====

Such were my
reflections
during the
first two or
three days of
my residence at
Ingolstadt,
which were
chiefly spent
in becoming
acquainted with
the localities
and the
principal
residents in my
new abode. But
as the ensuing
week commenced,
I thought of
the information
which M. Krempe
had given me
concerning the
lectures. And
although I
could not
consent to go
and hear that
little
conceited
fellow deliver
sentences out
of a pulpit, I
recollected
what he had
said of M.
Waldman, whom I
had never seen,
as he had
hitherto been
out of town.

=====

Partly from
curiosity and
partly from
idleness, I
went into the
lecturing room,
which M.
Waldman entered
shortly after.
This professor
was very unlike
his colleague.
He appeared
about fifty
years of age,
but with an
aspect
expressive of
the greatest
benevolence; a
few grey hairs
covered his
temples, but
those at the
back of his
head were
nearly black.
His person was
short but
remarkably
erect and his
voice the
sweetest I had
ever heard. He
began his
lecture by a
recapitulation
of the history
of chemistry
and the various
improvements
made by
different men
of learning,
pronouncing
with fervour
the names of
the most
distinguished
discoverers. He
then took a
cursory view of
the present
state of the
science and
explained many
of its
elementary
terms. After
having made a
few preparatory
experiments, he
concluded with
a panegyric
upon modern
chemistry, the
terms of which
I shall never
forget:

=====

“The ancient
teachers of
this science,”
said he,
“promised
impossibilities
and performed
nothing. The
modern masters
promise very
little; they
know that
metals cannot
be transmuted
and that the
elixir of life
is a chimera
but these
philosophers,
whose hands
seem only made
to dabble in
dirt, and their
eyes to pore
over the
microscope or
crucible, have
indeed
performed
miracles. They
penetrate into
the recesses of
nature and show
how she works
in her
hiding-places.
They ascend
into the
heavens; they
have discovered
how the blood
circulates, and
the nature of
the air we
breathe. They
have acquired
new and almost
unlimited
powers; they
can command the
thunders of
heaven, mimic
the earthquake,
and even mock
the invisible
world with its
own shadows.”

=====

I closed not my
eyes that
night. My
internal being
was in a state
of insurrection
and turmoil; I
felt that order
would thence
arise, but I
had no power to
produce it. By
degrees, after
the morning’s
dawn, sleep
came. I awoke,
and my
yesternight’s
thoughts were
as a dream.
There only
remained a
resolution to
return to my
ancient studies
and to devote
myself to a
science for
which I
believed myself
to possess a
natural talent.
On the same day
I paid M.
Waldman a
visit. His
manners in
private were
even more mild
and attractive
than in public,
for there was a
certain dignity
in his mien
during his
lecture which
in his own
house was
replaced by the
greatest
affability and
kindness. I
gave him pretty
nearly the same
account of my
former pursuits
as I had given
to his fellow
professor. He
heard with
attention the
little
narration
concerning my
studies and
smiled at the
names of
Cornelius
Agrippa and
Paracelsus, but
without the
contempt that
M. Krempe had
exhibited. He
said that
“These were men
to whose
indefatigable
zeal modern
philosophers
were indebted
for most of the
foundations of
their
knowledge. They
had left to us,
as an easier
task, to give
new names and
arrange in
connected
classifications
the facts which
they in a great
degree had been
the instruments
of bringing to
light. The
labours of men
of genius,
however
erroneously
directed,
scarcely ever
fail in
ultimately
turning to the
solid advantage
of mankind.” I
listened to his
statement,
which was
delivered
without any
presumption or
affectation,
and then added
that his
lecture had
removed my
prejudices
against modern
chemists; I
expressed
myself in
measured terms,
with the
modesty and
deference due
from a youth to
his instructor,
without letting
escape
(inexperience
in life would
have made me
ashamed) any of
the enthusiasm
which
stimulated my
intended
labours. I
requested his
advice
concerning the
books I ought
to procure.

=====

From this day
natural
philosophy, and
particularly
chemistry, in
the most
comprehensive
sense of the
term, became
nearly my sole
occupation. I
read with
ardour those
works, so full
of genius and
discrimination,
which modern
inquirers have
written on
these subjects.
I attended the
lectures and
cultivated the
acquaintance of
the men of
science of the
university, and
I found even in
M. Krempe a
great deal of
sound sense and
real
information,
combined, it is
true, with a
repulsive
physiognomy and
manners, but
not on that
account the
less valuable.
In M. Waldman I
found a true
friend. His
gentleness was
never tinged by
dogmatism, and
his
instructions
were given with
an air of
frankness and
good nature
that banished
every idea of
pedantry. In a
thousand ways
he smoothed for
me the path of
knowledge and
made the most
abstruse
inquiries clear
and facile to
my
apprehension.
My application
was at first
fluctuating and
uncertain; it
gained strength
as I proceeded
and soon became
so ardent and
eager that the
stars often
disappeared in
the light of
morning whilst
I was yet
engaged in my
laboratory.

=====

As I applied so
closely, it may
be easily
conceived that
my progress was
rapid. My
ardour was
indeed the
astonishment of
the students,
and my
proficiency
that of the
masters.
Professor
Krempe often
asked me, with
a sly smile,
how Cornelius
Agrippa went
on, whilst M.
Waldman
expressed the
most heartfelt
exultation in
my progress.
Two years
passed in this
manner, during
which I paid no
visit to
Geneva, but was
engaged, heart
and soul, in
the pursuit of
some
discoveries
which I hoped
to make. None
but those who
have
experienced
them can
conceive of the
enticements of
science. In
other studies
you go as far
as others have
gone before
you, and there
is nothing more
to know; but in
a scientific
pursuit there
is continual
food for
discovery and
wonder. A mind
of moderate
capacity which
closely pursues
one study must
infallibly
arrive at great
proficiency in
that study; and
I, who
continually
sought the
attainment of
one object of
pursuit and was
solely wrapped
up in this,
improved so
rapidly that at
the end of two
years I made
some
discoveries in
the improvement
of some
chemical
instruments,
which procured
me great esteem
and admiration
at the
university.
When I had
arrived at this
point and had
become as well
acquainted with
the theory and
practice of
natural
philosophy as
depended on the
lessons of any
of the
professors at
Ingolstadt, my
residence there
being no longer
conducive to my
improvements, I
thought of
returning to my
friends and my
native town,
when an
incident
happened that
protracted my
stay.

=====

One of the
phenomena which
had peculiarly
attracted my
attention was
the structure
of the human
frame, and,
indeed, any
animal endued
with life.
Whence, I often
asked myself,
did the
principle of
life proceed?
It was a bold
question, and
one which has
ever been
considered as a
mystery; yet
with how many
things are we
upon the brink
of becoming
acquainted, if
cowardice or
carelessness
did not
restrain our
inquiries. I
revolved these
circumstances
in my mind and
determined
thenceforth to
apply myself
more
particularly to
those branches
of natural
philosophy
which relate to
physiology.
Unless I had
been animated
by an almost
supernatural
enthusiasm, my
application to
this study
would have been
irksome and
almost
intolerable. To
examine the
causes of life,
we must first
have recourse
to death. I
became
acquainted with
the science of
anatomy, but
this was not
sufficient; I
must also
observe the
natural decay
and corruption
of the human
body. In my
education my
father had
taken the
greatest
precautions
that my mind
should be
impressed with
no supernatural
horrors. I do
not ever
remember to
have trembled
at a tale of
superstition or
to have feared
the apparition
of a spirit.
Darkness had no
effect upon my
fancy, and a
churchyard was
to me merely
the receptacle
of bodies
deprived of
life, which,
from being the
seat of beauty
and strength,
had become food
for the worm.
Now I was led
to examine the
cause and
progress of
this decay and
forced to spend
days and nights
in vaults and
charnel-houses.
My attention
was fixed upon
every object
the most
insupportable
to the delicacy
of the human
feelings. I saw
how the fine
form of man was
degraded and
wasted; I
beheld the
corruption of
death succeed
to the blooming
cheek of life;
I saw how the
worm inherited
the wonders of
the eye and
brain. I
paused,
examining and
analysing all
the minutiae of
causation, as
exemplified in
the change from
life to death,
and death to
life, until
from the midst
of this
darkness a
sudden light
broke in upon
me—a light so
brilliant and
wondrous, yet
so simple, that
while I became
dizzy with the
immensity of
the prospect
which it
illustrated, I
was surprised
that among so
many men of
genius who had
directed their
inquiries
towards the
same science,
that I alone
should be
reserved to
discover so
astonishing a
secret.

=====

The
astonishment
which I had at
first
experienced on
this discovery
soon gave place
to delight and
rapture. After
so much time
spent in
painful labour,
to arrive at
once at the
summit of my
desires was the
most gratifying
consummation of
my toils. But
this discovery
was so great
and
overwhelming
that all the
steps by which
I had been
progressively
led to it were
obliterated,
and I beheld
only the
result. What
had been the
study and
desire of the
wisest men
since the
creation of the
world was now
within my
grasp. Not
that, like a
magic scene, it
all opened upon
me at once: the
information I
had obtained
was of a nature
rather to
direct my
endeavours so
soon as I
should point
them towards
the object of
my search than
to exhibit that
object already
accomplished. I
was like the
Arabian who had
been buried
with the dead
and found a
passage to
life, aided
only by one
glimmering and
seemingly
ineffectual
light.

=====

I see by your
eagerness and
the wonder and
hope which your
eyes express,
my friend, that
you expect to
be informed of
the secret with
which I am
acquainted;
that cannot be;
listen
patiently until
the end of my
story, and you
will easily
perceive why I
am reserved
upon that
subject. I will
not lead you
on, unguarded
and ardent as I
then was, to
your
destruction and
infallible
misery. Learn
from me, if not
by my precepts,
at least by my
example, how
dangerous is
the acquirement
of knowledge
and how much
happier that
man is who
believes his
native town to
be the world,
than he who
aspires to
become greater
than his nature
will allow.

=====

No one can
conceive the
variety of
feelings which
bore me
onwards, like a
hurricane, in
the first
enthusiasm of
success. Life
and death
appeared to me
ideal bounds,
which I should
first break
through, and
pour a torrent
of light into
our dark world.
A new species
would bless me
as its creator
and source;
many happy and
excellent
natures would
owe their being
to me. No
father could
claim the
gratitude of
his child so
completely as I
should deserve
theirs.
Pursuing these
reflections, I
thought that if
I could bestow
animation upon
lifeless
matter, I might
in process of
time (although
I now found it
impossible)
renew life
where death had
apparently
devoted the
body to
corruption.

=====

These thoughts
supported my
spirits, while
I pursued my
undertaking
with
unremitting
ardour. My
cheek had grown
pale with
study, and my
person had
become
emaciated with
confinement.
Sometimes, on
the very brink
of certainty, I
failed; yet
still I clung
to the hope
which the next
day or the next
hour might
realise. One
secret which I
alone possessed
was the hope to
which I had
dedicated
myself; and the
moon gazed on
my midnight
labours, while,
with unrelaxed
and breathless
eagerness, I
pursued nature
to her
hiding-places.
Who shall
conceive the
horrors of my
secret toil as
I dabbled among
the unhallowed
damps of the
grave or
tortured the
living animal
to animate the
lifeless clay?
My limbs now
tremble, and my
eyes swim with
the
remembrance;
but then a
resistless and
almost frantic
impulse urged
me forward; I
seemed to have
lost all soul
or sensation
but for this
one pursuit. It
was indeed but
a passing
trance, that
only made me
feel with
renewed
acuteness so
soon as, the
unnatural
stimulus
ceasing to
operate, I had
returned to my
old habits. I
collected bones
from
charnel-houses
and disturbed,
with profane
fingers, the
tremendous
secrets of the
human frame. In
a solitary
chamber, or
rather cell, at
the top of the
house, and
separated from
all the other
apartments by a
gallery and
staircase, I
kept my
workshop of
filthy
creation; my
eyeballs were
starting from
their sockets
in attending to
the details of
my employment.
The dissecting
room and the
slaughter-house
furnished many
of my
materials; and
often did my
human nature
turn with
loathing from
my occupation,
whilst, still
urged on by an
eagerness which
perpetually
increased, I
brought my work
near to a
conclusion.

=====

The summer
months passed
while I was
thus engaged,
heart and soul,
in one pursuit.
It was a most
beautiful
season; never
did the fields
bestow a more
plentiful
harvest or the
vines yield a
more luxuriant
vintage, but my
eyes were
insensible to
the charms of
nature. And the
same feelings
which made me
neglect the
scenes around
me caused me
also to forget
those friends
who were so
many miles
absent, and
whom I had not
seen for so
long a time. I
knew my silence
disquieted
them, and I
well remembered
the words of my
father: “I know
that while you
are pleased
with yourself
you will think
of us with
affection, and
we shall hear
regularly from
you. You must
pardon me if I
regard any
interruption in
your
correspondence
as a proof that
your other
duties are
equally
neglected.”

=====

I then thought
that my father
would be unjust
if he ascribed
my neglect to
vice or
faultiness on
my part, but I
am now
convinced that
he was
justified in
conceiving that
I should not be
altogether free
from blame. A
human being in
perfection
ought always to
preserve a calm
and peaceful
mind and never
to allow
passion or a
transitory
desire to
disturb his
tranquillity. I
do not think
that the
pursuit of
knowledge is an
exception to
this rule. If
the study to
which you apply
yourself has a
tendency to
weaken your
affections and
to destroy your
taste for those
simple
pleasures in
which no alloy
can possibly
mix, then that
study is
certainly
unlawful, that
is to say, not
befitting the
human mind. If
this rule were
always
observed; if no
man allowed any
pursuit
whatsoever to
interfere with
the
tranquillity of
his domestic
affections,
Greece had not
been enslaved,
Cæsar would
have spared his
country,
America would
have been
discovered more
gradually, and
the empires of
Mexico and Peru
had not been
destroyed.

=====

My father made
no reproach in
his letters and
only took
notice of my
silence by
inquiring into
my occupations
more
particularly
than before.
Winter, spring,
and summer
passed away
during my
labours; but I
did not watch
the blossom or
the expanding
leaves—sights
which before
always yielded
me supreme
delight—so
deeply was I
engrossed in my
occupation. The
leaves of that
year had
withered before
my work drew
near to a
close, and now
every day
showed me more
plainly how
well I had
succeeded. But
my enthusiasm
was checked by
my anxiety, and
I appeared
rather like one
doomed by
slavery to toil
in the mines,
or any other
unwholesome
trade than an
artist occupied
by his
favourite
employment.
Every night I
was oppressed
by a slow
fever, and I
became nervous
to a most
painful degree;
the fall of a
leaf startled
me, and I
shunned my
fellow
creatures as if
I had been
guilty of a
crime.
Sometimes I
grew alarmed at
the wreck I
perceived that
I had become;
the energy of
my purpose
alone sustained
me: my labours
would soon end,
and I believed
that exercise
and amusement
would then
drive away
incipient
disease; and I
promised myself
both of these
when my
creation should
be complete.

=====

How can I
describe my
emotions at
this
catastrophe, or
how delineate
the wretch whom
with such
infinite pains
and care I had
endeavoured to
form? His limbs
were in
proportion, and
I had selected
his features as
beautiful.
Beautiful!
Great God! His
yellow skin
scarcely
covered the
work of muscles
and arteries
beneath; his
hair was of a
lustrous black,
and flowing;
his teeth of a
pearly
whiteness; but
these
luxuriances
only formed a
more horrid
contrast with
his watery
eyes, that
seemed almost
of the same
colour as the
dun-white
sockets in
which they were
set, his
shrivelled
complexion and
straight black
lips.

=====

The different
accidents of
life are not so
changeable as
the feelings of
human nature. I
had worked hard
for nearly two
years, for the
sole purpose of
infusing life
into an
inanimate body.
For this I had
deprived myself
of rest and
health. I had
desired it with
an ardour that
far exceeded
moderation; but
now that I had
finished, the
beauty of the
dream vanished,
and breathless
horror and
disgust filled
my heart.
Unable to
endure the
aspect of the
being I had
created, I
rushed out of
the room and
continued a
long time
traversing my
bed-chamber,
unable to
compose my mind
to sleep. At
length
lassitude
succeeded to
the tumult I
had before
endured, and I
threw myself on
the bed in my
clothes,
endeavouring to
seek a few
moments of
forgetfulness.
But it was in
vain; I slept,
indeed, but I
was disturbed
by the wildest
dreams. I
thought I saw
Elizabeth, in
the bloom of
health, walking
in the streets
of Ingolstadt.
Delighted and
surprised, I
embraced her,
but as I
imprinted the
first kiss on
her lips, they
became livid
with the hue of
death; her
features
appeared to
change, and I
thought that I
held the corpse
of my dead
mother in my
arms; a shroud
enveloped her
form, and I saw
the grave-worms
crawling in the
folds of the
flannel. I
started from my
sleep with
horror; a cold
dew covered my
forehead, my
teeth
chattered, and
every limb
became
convulsed;
when, by the
dim and yellow
light of the
moon, as it
forced its way
through the
window
shutters, I
beheld the
wretch—the
miserable
monster whom I
had created. He
held up the
curtain of the
bed; and his
eyes, if eyes
they may be
called, were
fixed on me.
His jaws
opened, and he
muttered some
inarticulate
sounds, while a
grin wrinkled
his cheeks. He
might have
spoken, but I
did not hear;
one hand was
stretched out,
seemingly to
detain me, but
I escaped and
rushed
downstairs. I
took refuge in
the courtyard
belonging to
the house which
I inhabited,
where I
remained during
the rest of the
night, walking
up and down in
the greatest
agitation,
listening
attentively,
catching and
fearing each
sound as if it
were to
announce the
approach of the
demoniacal
corpse to which
I had so
miserably given
life.

=====

Morning, dismal
and wet, at
length dawned
and discovered
to my sleepless
and aching eyes
the church of
Ingolstadt, its
white steeple
and clock,
which indicated
the sixth hour.
The porter
opened the
gates of the
court, which
had that night
been my asylum,
and I issued
into the
streets, pacing
them with quick
steps, as if I
sought to avoid
the wretch whom
I feared every
turning of the
street would
present to my
view. I did not
dare return to
the apartment
which I
inhabited, but
felt impelled
to hurry on,
although
drenched by the
rain which
poured from a
black and
comfortless
sky.

=====

I continued
walking in this
manner for some
time,
endeavouring by
bodily exercise
to ease the
load that
weighed upon my
mind. I
traversed the
streets without
any clear
conception of
where I was or
what I was
doing. My heart
palpitated in
the sickness of
fear, and I
hurried on with
irregular
steps, not
daring to look
about me: Like
one who, on a
lonely road,
Doth walk in
fear and dread,
And, having
once turned
round, walks
on, And turns
no more his
head; Because
he knows a
frightful fiend
Doth close
behind him
tread.
[Coleridge’s
“Ancient
Mariner.”]

=====

Continuing
thus, I came at
length opposite
to the inn at
which the
various
diligences and
carriages
usually
stopped. Here I
paused, I knew
not why; but I
remained some
minutes with my
eyes fixed on a
coach that was
coming towards
me from the
other end of
the street. As
it drew nearer
I observed that
it was the
Swiss
diligence; it
stopped just
where I was
standing, and
on the door
being opened, I
perceived Henry
Clerval, who,
on seeing me,
instantly
sprung out. “My
dear
Frankenstein,”
exclaimed he,
“how glad I am
to see you! How
fortunate that
you should be
here at the
very moment of
my alighting!”

=====

Nothing could
equal my
delight on
seeing Clerval;
his presence
brought back to
my thoughts my
father,
Elizabeth, and
all those
scenes of home
so dear to my
recollection. I
grasped his
hand, and in a
moment forgot
my horror and
misfortune; I
felt suddenly,
and for the
first time
during many
months, calm
and serene joy.
I welcomed my
friend,
therefore, in
the most
cordial manner,
and we walked
towards my
college.
Clerval
continued
talking for
some time about
our mutual
friends and his
own good
fortune in
being permitted
to come to
Ingolstadt.
“You may easily
believe,” said
he, “how great
was the
difficulty to
persuade my
father that all
necessary
knowledge was
not comprised
in the noble
art of
book-keeping;
and, indeed, I
believe I left
him incredulous
to the last,
for his
constant answer
to my unwearied
entreaties was
the same as
that of the
Dutch
schoolmaster in
The Vicar of
Wakefield: ‘I
have ten
thousand
florins a year
without Greek,
I eat heartily
without Greek.’
But his
affection for
me at length
overcame his
dislike of
learning, and
he has
permitted me to
undertake a
voyage of
discovery to
the land of
knowledge.”

=====

I trembled
excessively; I
could not
endure to think
of, and far
less to allude
to, the
occurrences of
the preceding
night. I walked
with a quick
pace, and we
soon arrived at
my college. I
then reflected,
and the thought
made me shiver,
that the
creature whom I
had left in my
apartment might
still be there,
alive and
walking about.
I dreaded to
behold this
monster, but I
feared still
more that Henry
should see him.
Entreating him,
therefore, to
remain a few
minutes at the
bottom of the
stairs, I
darted up
towards my own
room. My hand
was already on
the lock of the
door before I
recollected
myself. I then
paused, and a
cold shivering
came over me. I
threw the door
forcibly open,
as children are
accustomed to
do when they
expect a
spectre to
stand in
waiting for
them on the
other side; but
nothing
appeared. I
stepped
fearfully in:
the apartment
was empty, and
my bedroom was
also freed from
its hideous
guest. I could
hardly believe
that so great a
good fortune
could have
befallen me,
but when I
became assured
that my enemy
had indeed
fled, I clapped
my hands for
joy and ran
down to
Clerval.

=====

We ascended
into my room,
and the servant
presently
brought
breakfast; but
I was unable to
contain myself.
It was not joy
only that
possessed me; I
felt my flesh
tingle with
excess of
sensitiveness,
and my pulse
beat rapidly. I
was unable to
remain for a
single instant
in the same
place; I jumped
over the
chairs, clapped
my hands, and
laughed aloud.
Clerval at
first
attributed my
unusual spirits
to joy on his
arrival, but
when he
observed me
more
attentively, he
saw a wildness
in my eyes for
which he could
not account,
and my loud,
unrestrained,
heartless
laughter
frightened and
astonished him.

=====

This was the
commencement of
a nervous fever
which confined
me for several
months. During
all that time
Henry was my
only nurse. I
afterwards
learned that,
knowing my
father’s
advanced age
and unfitness
for so long a
journey, and
how wretched my
sickness would
make Elizabeth,
he spared them
this grief by
concealing the
extent of my
disorder. He
knew that I
could not have
a more kind and
attentive nurse
than himself;
and, firm in
the hope he
felt of my
recovery, he
did not doubt
that, instead
of doing harm,
he performed
the kindest
action that he
could towards
them.

=====

But I was in
reality very
ill, and surely
nothing but the
unbounded and
unremitting
attentions of
my friend could
have restored
me to life. The
form of the
monster on whom
I had bestowed
existence was
for ever before
my eyes, and I
raved
incessantly
concerning him.
Doubtless my
words surprised
Henry; he at
first believed
them to be the
wanderings of
my disturbed
imagination,
but the
pertinacity
with which I
continually
recurred to the
same subject
persuaded him
that my
disorder indeed
owed its origin
to some
uncommon and
terrible event.

=====

By very slow
degrees, and
with frequent
relapses that
alarmed and
grieved my
friend, I
recovered. I
remember the
first time I
became capable
of observing
outward objects
with any kind
of pleasure, I
perceived that
the fallen
leaves had
disappeared and
that the young
buds were
shooting forth
from the trees
that shaded my
window. It was
a divine
spring, and the
season
contributed
greatly to my
convalescence.
I felt also
sentiments of
joy and
affection
revive in my
bosom; my gloom
disappeared,
and in a short
time I became
as cheerful as
before I was
attacked by the
fatal passion.

=====

“You have been
ill, very ill,
and even the
constant
letters of dear
kind Henry are
not sufficient
to reassure me
on your
account. You
are forbidden
to write—to
hold a pen; yet
one word from
you, dear
Victor, is
necessary to
calm our
apprehensions.
For a long time
I have thought
that each post
would bring
this line, and
my persuasions
have restrained
my uncle from
undertaking a
journey to
Ingolstadt. I
have prevented
his
encountering
the
inconveniences
and perhaps
dangers of so
long a journey,
yet how often
have I
regretted not
being able to
perform it
myself! I
figure to
myself that the
task of
attending on
your sickbed
has devolved on
some mercenary
old nurse, who
could never
guess your
wishes nor
minister to
them with the
care and
affection of
your poor
cousin. Yet
that is over
now: Clerval
writes that
indeed you are
getting better.
I eagerly hope
that you will
confirm this
intelligence
soon in your
own
handwriting.

=====

“Get well—and
return to us.
You will find a
happy, cheerful
home and
friends who
love you
dearly. Your
father’s health
is vigorous,
and he asks but
to see you, but
to be assured
that you are
well; and not a
care will ever
cloud his
benevolent
countenance.
How pleased you
would be to
remark the
improvement of
our Ernest! He
is now sixteen
and full of
activity and
spirit. He is
desirous to be
a true Swiss
and to enter
into foreign
service, but we
cannot part
with him, at
least until his
elder brother
returns to us.
My uncle is not
pleased with
the idea of a
military career
in a distant
country, but
Ernest never
had your powers
of application.
He looks upon
study as an
odious fetter;
his time is
spent in the
open air,
climbing the
hills or rowing
on the lake. I
fear that he
will become an
idler unless we
yield the point
and permit him
to enter on the
profession
which he has
selected.

=====

“Little
alteration,
except the
growth of our
dear children,
has taken place
since you left
us. The blue
lake and
snow-clad
mountains—they
never change;
and I think our
placid home and
our contented
hearts are
regulated by
the same
immutable laws.
My trifling
occupations
take up my time
and amuse me,
and I am
rewarded for
any exertions
by seeing none
but happy, kind
faces around
me. Since you
left us, but
one change has
taken place in
our little
household. Do
you remember on
what occasion
Justine Moritz
entered our
family?
Probably you do
not; I will
relate her
history,
therefore in a
few words.
Madame Moritz,
her mother, was
a widow with
four children,
of whom Justine
was the third.
This girl had
always been the
favourite of
her father, but
through a
strange
perversity, her
mother could
not endure her,
and after the
death of M.
Moritz, treated
her very ill.
My aunt
observed this,
and when
Justine was
twelve years of
age, prevailed
on her mother
to allow her to
live at our
house. The
republican
institutions of
our country
have produced
simpler and
happier manners
than those
which prevail
in the great
monarchies that
surround it.
Hence there is
less
distinction
between the
several classes
of its
inhabitants;
and the lower
orders, being
neither so poor
nor so
despised, their
manners are
more refined
and moral. A
servant in
Geneva does not
mean the same
thing as a
servant in
France and
England.
Justine, thus
received in our
family, learned
the duties of a
servant, a
condition
which, in our
fortunate
country, does
not include the
idea of
ignorance and a
sacrifice of
the dignity of
a human being.

=====

“Justine, you
may remember,
was a great
favourite of
yours; and I
recollect you
once remarked
that if you
were in an ill
humour, one
glance from
Justine could
dissipate it,
for the same
reason that
Ariosto gives
concerning the
beauty of
Angelica—she
looked so
frank-hearted
and happy. My
aunt conceived
a great
attachment for
her, by which
she was induced
to give her an
education
superior to
that which she
had at first
intended. This
benefit was
fully repaid;
Justine was the
most grateful
little creature
in the world: I
do not mean
that she made
any professions
I never heard
one pass her
lips, but you
could see by
her eyes that
she almost
adored her
protectress.
Although her
disposition was
gay and in many
respects
inconsiderate,
yet she paid
the greatest
attention to
every gesture
of my aunt. She
thought her the
model of all
excellence and
endeavoured to
imitate her
phraseology and
manners, so
that even now
she often
reminds me of
her.

=====

“One by one,
her brothers
and sister
died; and her
mother, with
the exception
of her
neglected
daughter, was
left childless.
The conscience
of the woman
was troubled;
she began to
think that the
deaths of her
favourites was
a judgement
from heaven to
chastise her
partiality. She
was a Roman
Catholic; and I
believe her
confessor
confirmed the
idea which she
had conceived.
Accordingly, a
few months
after your
departure for
Ingolstadt,
Justine was
called home by
her repentant
mother. Poor
girl! She wept
when she
quitted our
house; she was
much altered
since the death
of my aunt;
grief had given
softness and a
winning
mildness to her
manners, which
had before been
remarkable for
vivacity. Nor
was her
residence at
her mother’s
house of a
nature to
restore her
gaiety. The
poor woman was
very
vacillating in
her repentance.
She sometimes
begged Justine
to forgive her
unkindness, but
much oftener
accused her of
having caused
the deaths of
her brothers
and sister.
Perpetual
fretting at
length threw
Madame Moritz
into a decline,
which at first
increased her
irritability,
but she is now
at peace for
ever. She died
on the first
approach of
cold weather,
at the
beginning of
this last
winter. Justine
has just
returned to us;
and I assure
you I love her
tenderly. She
is very clever
and gentle, and
extremely
pretty; as I
mentioned
before, her
mien and her
expression
continually
remind me of my
dear aunt.

=====

“Now, dear
Victor, I dare
say you wish to
be indulged in
a little gossip
concerning the
good people of
Geneva. The
pretty Miss
Mansfield has
already
received the
congratulatory
visits on her
approaching
marriage with a
young
Englishman,
John Melbourne,
Esq. Her ugly
sister, Manon,
married M.
Duvillard, the
rich banker,
last autumn.
Your favourite
schoolfellow,
Louis Manoir,
has suffered
several
misfortunes
since the
departure of
Clerval from
Geneva. But he
has already
recovered his
spirits, and is
reported to be
on the point of
marrying a
lively pretty
Frenchwoman,
Madame
Tavernier. She
is a widow, and
much older than
Manoir; but she
is very much
admired, and a
favourite with
everybody.

=====

One of my first
duties on my
recovery was to
introduce
Clerval to the
several
professors of
the university.
In doing this,
I underwent a
kind of rough
usage, ill
befitting the
wounds that my
mind had
sustained. Ever
since the fatal
night, the end
of my labours,
and the
beginning of my
misfortunes, I
had conceived a
violent
antipathy even
to the name of
natural
philosophy.
When I was
otherwise quite
restored to
health, the
sight of a
chemical
instrument
would renew all
the agony of my
nervous
symptoms. Henry
saw this, and
had removed all
my apparatus
from my view.
He had also
changed my
apartment; for
he perceived
that I had
acquired a
dislike for the
room which had
previously been
my laboratory.
But these cares
of Clerval were
made of no
avail when I
visited the
professors. M.
Waldman
inflicted
torture when he
praised, with
kindness and
warmth, the
astonishing
progress I had
made in the
sciences. He
soon perceived
that I disliked
the subject;
but not
guessing the
real cause, he
attributed my
feelings to
modesty, and
changed the
subject from my
improvement, to
the science
itself, with a
desire, as I
evidently saw,
of drawing me
out. What could
I do? He meant
to please, and
he tormented
me. I felt as
if he had
placed
carefully, one
by one, in my
view those
instruments
which were to
be afterwards
used in putting
me to a slow
and cruel
death. I
writhed under
his words, yet
dared not
exhibit the
pain I felt.
Clerval, whose
eyes and
feelings were
always quick in
discerning the
sensations of
others,
declined the
subject,
alleging, in
excuse, his
total
ignorance; and
the
conversation
took a more
general turn. I
thanked my
friend from my
heart, but I
did not speak.
I saw plainly
that he was
surprised, but
he never
attempted to
draw my secret
from me; and
although I
loved him with
a mixture of
affection and
reverence that
knew no bounds,
yet I could
never persuade
myself to
confide in him
that event
which was so
often present
to my
recollection,
but which I
feared the
detail to
another would
only impress
more deeply.

=====

Clerval had
never
sympathised in
my tastes for
natural
science; and
his literary
pursuits
differed wholly
from those
which had
occupied me. He
came to the
university with
the design of
making himself
complete master
of the oriental
languages, and
thus he should
open a field
for the plan of
life he had
marked out for
himself.
Resolved to
pursue no
inglorious
career, he
turned his eyes
toward the
East, as
affording scope
for his spirit
of enterprise.
The Persian,
Arabic, and
Sanskrit
languages
engaged his
attention, and
I was easily
induced to
enter on the
same studies.
Idleness had
ever been
irksome to me,
and now that I
wished to fly
from
reflection, and
hated my former
studies, I felt
great relief in
being the
fellow-pupil
with my friend,
and found not
only
instruction but
consolation in
the works of
the
orientalists. I
did not, like
him, attempt a
critical
knowledge of
their dialects,
for I did not
contemplate
making any
other use of
them than
temporary
amusement. I
read merely to
understand
their meaning,
and they well
repaid my
labours. Their
melancholy is
soothing, and
their joy
elevating, to a
degree I never
experienced in
studying the
authors of any
other country.
When you read
their writings,
life appears to
consist in a
warm sun and a
garden of
roses,—in the
smiles and
frowns of a
fair enemy, and
the fire that
consumes your
own heart. How
different from
the manly and
heroical poetry
of Greece and
Rome!

=====

Summer passed
away in these
occupations,
and my return
to Geneva was
fixed for the
latter end of
autumn; but
being delayed
by several
accidents,
winter and snow
arrived, the
roads were
deemed
impassable, and
my journey was
retarded until
the ensuing
spring. I felt
this delay very
bitterly; for I
longed to see
my native town
and my beloved
friends. My
return had only
been delayed so
long, from an
unwillingness
to leave
Clerval in a
strange place,
before he had
become
acquainted with
any of its
inhabitants.
The winter,
however, was
spent
cheerfully; and
although the
spring was
uncommonly
late, when it
came its beauty
compensated for
its
dilatoriness.

=====

Henry rejoiced
in my gaiety,
and sincerely
sympathised in
my feelings: he
exerted himself
to amuse me,
while he
expressed the
sensations that
filled his
soul. The
resources of
his mind on
this occasion
were truly
astonishing:
his
conversation
was full of
imagination;
and very often,
in imitation of
the Persian and
Arabic writers,
he invented
tales of
wonderful fancy
and passion. At
other times he
repeated my
favourite
poems, or drew
me out into
arguments,
which he
supported with
great
ingenuity.

=====

“You have
probably waited
impatiently for
a letter to fix
the date of
your return to
us; and I was
at first
tempted to
write only a
few lines,
merely
mentioning the
day on which I
should expect
you. But that
would be a
cruel kindness,
and I dare not
do it. What
would be your
surprise, my
son, when you
expected a
happy and glad
welcome, to
behold, on the
contrary, tears
and
wretchedness?
And how,
Victor, can I
relate our
misfortune?
Absence cannot
have rendered
you callous to
our joys and
griefs; and how
shall I inflict
pain on my long
absent son? I
wish to prepare
you for the
woeful news,
but I know it
is impossible;
even now your
eye skims over
the page to
seek the words
which are to
convey to you
the horrible
tidings.

=====

“Last Thursday
(May 7th), I,
my niece, and
your two
brothers, went
to walk in
Plainpalais.
The evening was
warm and
serene, and we
prolonged our
walk farther
than usual. It
was already
dusk before we
thought of
returning; and
then we
discovered that
William and
Ernest, who had
gone on before,
were not to be
found. We
accordingly
rested on a
seat until they
should return.
Presently
Ernest came,
and enquired if
we had seen his
brother; he
said, that he
had been
playing with
him, that
William had run
away to hide
himself, and
that he vainly
sought for him,
and afterwards
waited for a
long time, but
that he did not
return.

=====

“This account
rather alarmed
us, and we
continued to
search for him
until night
fell, when
Elizabeth
conjectured
that he might
have returned
to the house.
He was not
there. We
returned again,
with torches;
for I could not
rest, when I
thought that my
sweet boy had
lost himself,
and was exposed
to all the
damps and dews
of night;
Elizabeth also
suffered
extreme
anguish. About
five in the
morning I
discovered my
lovely boy,
whom the night
before I had
seen blooming
and active in
health,
stretched on
the grass livid
and motionless;
the print of
the murder’s
finger was on
his neck.

=====

During our
walk, Clerval
endeavoured to
say a few words
of consolation;
he could only
express his
heartfelt
sympathy. “Poor
William!” said
he, “dear
lovely child,
he now sleeps
with his angel
mother! Who
that had seen
him bright and
joyous in his
young beauty,
but must weep
over his
untimely loss!
To die so
miserably; to
feel the
murderer’s
grasp! How much
more a murdered
that could
destroy radiant
innocence! Poor
little fellow!
one only
consolation
have we; his
friends mourn
and weep, but
he is at rest.
The pang is
over, his
sufferings are
at an end for
ever. A sod
covers his
gentle form,
and he knows no
pain. He can no
longer be a
subject for
pity; we must
reserve that
for his
miserable
survivors.”

=====

My journey was
very
melancholy. At
first I wished
to hurry on,
for I longed to
console and
sympathise with
my loved and
sorrowing
friends; but
when I drew
near my native
town, I
slackened my
progress. I
could hardly
sustain the
multitude of
feelings that
crowded into my
mind. I passed
through scenes
familiar to my
youth, but
which I had not
seen for nearly
six years. How
altered every
thing might be
during that
time! One
sudden and
desolating
change had
taken place;
but a thousand
little
circumstances
might have by
degrees worked
other
alterations,
which, although
they were done
more
tranquilly,
might not be
the less
decisive. Fear
overcame me; I
dared no
advance,
dreading a
thousand
nameless evils
that made me
tremble,
although I was
unable to
define them.

=====

It was
completely dark
when I arrived
in the environs
of Geneva; the
gates of the
town were
already shut;
and I was
obliged to pass
the night at
Secheron, a
village at the
distance of
half a league
from the city.
The sky was
serene; and, as
I was unable to
rest, I
resolved to
visit the spot
where my poor
William had
been murdered.
As I could not
pass through
the town, I was
obliged to
cross the lake
in a boat to
arrive at
Plainpalais.
During this
short voyage I
saw the
lightning
playing on the
summit of Mont
Blanc in the
most beautiful
figures. The
storm appeared
to approach
rapidly, and,
on landing, I
ascended a low
hill, that I
might observe
its progress.
It advanced;
the heavens
were clouded,
and I soon felt
the rain coming
slowly in large
drops, but its
violence
quickly
increased.

=====

I quitted my
seat, and
walked on,
although the
darkness and
storm increased
every minute,
and the thunder
burst with a
terrific crash
over my head.
It was echoed
from Salêve,
the Juras, and
the Alps of
Savoy; vivid
flashes of
lightning
dazzled my
eyes,
illuminating
the lake,
making it
appear like a
vast sheet of
fire; then for
an instant
every thing
seemed of a
pitchy
darkness, until
the eye
recovered
itself from the
preceding
flash. The
storm, as is
often the case
in Switzerland,
appeared at
once in various
parts of the
heavens. The
most violent
storm hung
exactly north
of the town,
over the part
of the lake
which lies
between the
promontory of
Belrive and the
village of
Copêt. Another
storm
enlightened
Jura with faint
flashes; and
another
darkened and
sometimes
disclosed the
Môle, a peaked
mountain to the
east of the
lake.

=====

While I watched
the tempest, so
beautiful yet
terrific, I
wandered on
with a hasty
step. This
noble war in
the sky
elevated my
spirits; I
clasped my
hands, and
exclaimed
aloud,
“William, dear
angel! this is
thy funeral,
this thy
dirge!” As I
said these
words, I
perceived in
the gloom a
figure which
stole from
behind a clump
of trees near
me; I stood
fixed, gazing
intently: I
could not be
mistaken. A
flash of
lightning
illuminated the
object, and
discovered its
shape plainly
to me; its
gigantic
stature, and
the deformity
of its aspect
more hideous
than belongs to
humanity,
instantly
informed me
that it was the
wretch, the
filthy dæmon,
to whom I had
given life.
What did he
there? Could he
be (I shuddered
at the
conception) the
murderer of my
brother? No
sooner did that
idea cross my
imagination,
than I became
convinced of
its truth; my
teeth
chattered, and
I was forced to
lean against a
tree for
support. The
figure passed
me quickly, and
I lost it in
the gloom.
Nothing in
human shape
could have
destroyed the
fair child.
_He_ was the
murderer! I
could not doubt
it. The mere
presence of the
idea was an
irresistible
proof of the
fact. I thought
of pursuing the
devil; but it
would have been
in vain, for
another flash
discovered him
to me hanging
among the rocks
of the nearly
perpendicular
ascent of Mont
Salêve, a hill
that bounds
Plainpalais on
the south. He
soon reached
the summit, and
disappeared.

=====

I remained
motionless. The
thunder ceased;
but the rain
still
continued, and
the scene was
enveloped in an
impenetrable
darkness. I
revolved in my
mind the events
which I had
until now
sought to
forget: the
whole train of
my progress
toward the
creation; the
appearance of
the works of my
own hands at my
bedside; its
departure. Two
years had now
nearly elapsed
since the night
on which he
first received
life; and was
this his first
crime? Alas! I
had turned
loose into the
world a
depraved
wretch, whose
delight was in
carnage and
misery; had he
not murdered my
brother?

=====

No one can
conceive the
anguish I
suffered during
the remainder
of the night,
which I spent,
cold and wet,
in the open
air. But I did
not feel the
inconvenience
of the weather;
my imagination
was busy in
scenes of evil
and despair. I
considered the
being whom I
had cast among
mankind, and
endowed with
the will and
power to effect
purposes of
horror, such as
the deed which
he had now
done, nearly in
the light of my
own vampire, my
own spirit let
loose from the
grave, and
forced to
destroy all
that was dear
to me.

=====

Day dawned; and
I directed my
steps towards
the town. The
gates were
open, and I
hastened to my
father’s house.
My first
thought was to
discover what I
knew of the
murderer, and
cause instant
pursuit to be
made. But I
paused when I
reflected on
the story that
I had to tell.
A being whom I
myself had
formed, and
endued with
life, had met
me at midnight
among the
precipices of
an inaccessible
mountain. I
remembered also
the nervous
fever with
which I had
been seized
just at the
time that I
dated my
creation, and
which would
give an air of
delirium to a
tale otherwise
so utterly
improbable. I
well knew that
if any other
had
communicated
such a relation
to me, I should
have looked
upon it as the
ravings of
insanity.
Besides, the
strange nature
of the animal
would elude all
pursuit, even
if I were so
far credited as
to persuade my
relatives to
commence it.
And then of
what use would
be pursuit? Who
could arrest a
creature
capable of
scaling the
overhanging
sides of Mont
Salêve? These
reflections
determined me,
and I resolved
to remain
silent.

=====

He then related
that, the
morning on
which the
murder of poor
William had
been
discovered,
Justine had
been taken ill,
and confined to
her bed for
several days.
During this
interval, one
of the
servants,
happening to
examine the
apparel she had
worn on the
night of the
murder, had
discovered in
her pocket the
picture of my
mother, which
had been judged
to be the
temptation of
the murderer.
The servant
instantly
showed it to
one of the
others, who,
without saying
a word to any
of the family,
went to a
magistrate;
and, upon their
deposition,
Justine was
apprehended. On
being charged
with the fact,
the poor girl
confirmed the
suspicion in a
great measure
by her extreme
confusion of
manner.

=====

This speech
calmed me. I
was firmly
convinced in my
own mind that
Justine, and
indeed every
human being,
was guiltless
of this murder.
I had no fear,
therefore, that
any
circumstantial
evidence could
be brought
forward strong
enough to
convict her. My
tale was not
one to announce
publicly; its
astounding
horror would be
looked upon as
madness by the
vulgar. Did any
one indeed
exist, except
I, the creator,
who would
believe, unless
his senses
convinced him,
in the
existence of
the living
monument of
presumption and
rash ignorance
which I had let
loose upon the
world?

=====

We were soon
joined by
Elizabeth. Time
had altered her
since I last
beheld her; it
had endowed her
with loveliness
surpassing the
beauty of her
childish years.
There was the
same candour,
the same
vivacity, but
it was allied
to an
expression more
full of
sensibility and
intellect. She
welcomed me
with the
greatest
affection.
“Your arrival,
my dear
cousin,” said
she, “fills me
with hope. You
perhaps will
find some means
to justify my
poor guiltless
Justine. Alas!
who is safe, if
she be
convicted of
crime? I rely
on her
innocence as
certainly as I
do upon my own.
Our misfortune
is doubly hard
to us; we have
not only lost
that lovely
darling boy,
but this poor
girl, whom I
sincerely love,
is to be torn
away by even a
worse fate. If
she is
condemned, I
never shall
know joy more.
But she will
not, I am sure
she will not;
and then I
shall be happy
again, even
after the sad
death of my
little
William.”

=====

We passed a few
sad hours until
eleven o’clock,
when the trial
was to
commence. My
father and the
rest of the
family being
obliged to
attend as
witnesses, I
accompanied
them to the
court. During
the whole of
this wretched
mockery of
justice I
suffered living
torture. It was
to be decided
whether the
result of my
curiosity and
lawless devices
would cause the
death of two of
my fellow
beings: one a
smiling babe
full of
innocence and
joy, the other
far more
dreadfully
murdered, with
every
aggravation of
infamy that
could make the
murder
memorable in
horror. Justine
also was a girl
of merit and
possessed
qualities which
promised to
render her life
happy; now all
was to be
obliterated in
an ignominious
grave, and I
the cause! A
thousand times
rather would I
have confessed
myself guilty
of the crime
ascribed to
Justine, but I
was absent when
it was
committed, and
such a
declaration
would have been
considered as
the ravings of
a madman and
would not have
exculpated her
who suffered
through me.

=====

The appearance
of Justine was
calm. She was
dressed in
mourning, and
her
countenance,
always
engaging, was
rendered, by
the solemnity
of her
feelings,
exquisitely
beautiful. Yet
she appeared
confident in
innocence and
did not
tremble,
although gazed
on and
execrated by
thousands, for
all the
kindness which
her beauty
might otherwise
have excited
was obliterated
in the minds of
the spectators
by the
imagination of
the enormity
she was
supposed to
have committed.
She was
tranquil, yet
her
tranquillity
was evidently
constrained;
and as her
confusion had
before been
adduced as a
proof of her
guilt, she
worked up her
mind to an
appearance of
courage. When
she entered the
court she threw
her eyes round
it and quickly
discovered
where we were
seated. A tear
seemed to dim
her eye when
she saw us, but
she quickly
recovered
herself, and a
look of
sorrowful
affection
seemed to
attest her
utter
guiltlessness.

=====

The trial
began, and
after the
advocate
against her had
stated the
charge, several
witnesses were
called. Several
strange facts
combined
against her,
which might
have staggered
anyone who had
not such proof
of her
innocence as I
had. She had
been out the
whole of the
night on which
the murder had
been committed
and towards
morning had
been perceived
by a
market-woman
not far from
the spot where
the body of the
murdered child
had been
afterwards
found. The
woman asked her
what she did
there, but she
looked very
strangely and
only returned a
confused and
unintelligible
answer. She
returned to the
house about
eight o’clock,
and when one
inquired where
she had passed
the night, she
replied that
she had been
looking for the
child and
demanded
earnestly if
anything had
been heard
concerning him.
When shown the
body, she fell
into violent
hysterics and
kept her bed
for several
days. The
picture was
then produced
which the
servant had
found in her
pocket; and
when Elizabeth,
in a faltering
voice, proved
that it was the
same which, an
hour before the
child had been
missed, she had
placed round
his neck, a
murmur of
horror and
indignation
filled the
court.

=====

She then
related that,
by the
permission of
Elizabeth, she
had passed the
evening of the
night on which
the murder had
been committed
at the house of
an aunt at
Chêne, a
village
situated at
about a league
from Geneva. On
her return, at
about nine
o’clock, she
met a man who
asked her if
she had seen
anything of the
child who was
lost. She was
alarmed by this
account and
passed several
hours in
looking for
him, when the
gates of Geneva
were shut, and
she was forced
to remain
several hours
of the night in
a barn
belonging to a
cottage, being
unwilling to
call up the
inhabitants, to
whom she was
well known.
Most of the
night she spent
here watching;
towards morning
she believed
that she slept
for a few
minutes; some
steps disturbed
her, and she
awoke. It was
dawn, and she
quitted her
asylum, that
she might again
endeavour to
find my
brother. If she
had gone near
the spot where
his body lay,
it was without
her knowledge.
That she had
been bewildered
when questioned
by the
market-woman
was not
surprising,
since she had
passed a
sleepless night
and the fate of
poor William
was yet
uncertain.
Concerning the
picture she
could give no
account.

=====

“I know,”
continued the
unhappy victim,
“how heavily
and fatally
this one
circumstance
weighs against
me, but I have
no power of
explaining it;
and when I have
expressed my
utter
ignorance, I am
only left to
conjecture
concerning the
probabilities
by which it
might have been
placed in my
pocket. But
here also I am
checked. I
believe that I
have no enemy
on earth, and
none surely
would have been
so wicked as to
destroy me
wantonly. Did
the murderer
place it there?
I know of no
opportunity
afforded him
for so doing;
or, if I had,
why should he
have stolen the
jewel, to part
with it again
so soon?

=====

“I am,” said
she, “the
cousin of the
unhappy child
who was
murdered, or
rather his
sister, for I
was educated by
and have lived
with his
parents ever
since and even
long before his
birth. It may
therefore be
judged indecent
in me to come
forward on this
occasion, but
when I see a
fellow creature
about to perish
through the
cowardice of
her pretended
friends, I wish
to be allowed
to speak, that
I may say what
I know of her
character. I am
well acquainted
with the
accused. I have
lived in the
same house with
her, at one
time for five
and at another
for nearly two
years. During
all that period
she appeared to
me the most
amiable and
benevolent of
human
creatures. She
nursed Madame
Frankenstein,
my aunt, in her
last illness,
with the
greatest
affection and
care and
afterwards
attended her
own mother
during a
tedious
illness, in a
manner that
excited the
admiration of
all who knew
her, after
which she again
lived in my
uncle’s house,
where she was
beloved by all
the family. She
was warmly
attached to the
child who is
now dead and
acted towards
him like a most
affectionate
mother. For my
own part, I do
not hesitate to
say that,
notwithstanding
all the
evidence
produced
against her, I
believe and
rely on her
perfect
innocence. She
had no
temptation for
such an action;
as to the
bauble on which
the chief proof
rests, if she
had earnestly
desired it, I
should have
willingly given
it to her, so
much do I
esteem and
value her.”

=====

A murmur of
approbation
followed
Elizabeth’s
simple and
powerful
appeal, but it
was excited by
her generous
interference,
and not in
favour of poor
Justine, on
whom the public
indignation was
turned with
renewed
violence,
charging her
with the
blackest
ingratitude.
She herself
wept as
Elizabeth
spoke, but she
did not answer.
My own
agitation and
anguish was
extreme during
the whole
trial. I
believed in her
innocence; I
knew it. Could
the dæmon who
had (I did not
for a minute
doubt) murdered
my brother also
in his hellish
sport have
betrayed the
innocent to
death and
ignominy? I
could not
sustain the
horror of my
situation, and
when I
perceived that
the popular
voice and the
countenances of
the judges had
already
condemned my
unhappy victim,
I rushed out of
the court in
agony. The
tortures of the
accused did not
equal mine; she
was sustained
by innocence,
but the fangs
of remorse tore
my bosom and
would not forgo
their hold.

=====

I cannot
pretend to
describe what I
then felt. I
had before
experienced
sensations of
horror, and I
have
endeavoured to
bestow upon
them adequate
expressions,
but words
cannot convey
an idea of the
heart-sickening
despair that I
then endured.
The person to
whom I
addressed
myself added
that Justine
had already
confessed her
guilt. “That
evidence,” he
observed, “was
hardly required
in so glaring a
case, but I am
glad of it,
and, indeed,
none of our
judges like to
condemn a
criminal upon
circumstantial
evidence, be it
ever so
decisive.”

=====

“I did confess,
but I confessed
a lie. I
confessed, that
I might obtain
absolution; but
now that
falsehood lies
heavier at my
heart than all
my other sins.
The God of
heaven forgive
me! Ever since
I was
condemned, my
confessor has
besieged me; he
threatened and
menaced, until
I almost began
to think that I
was the monster
that he said I
was. He
threatened
excommunication
and hell fire
in my last
moments if I
continued
obdurate. Dear
lady, I had
none to support
me; all looked
on me as a
wretch doomed
to ignominy and
perdition. What
could I do? In
an evil hour I
subscribed to a
lie; and now
only am I truly
miserable.”

=====

During this
conversation I
had retired to
a corner of the
prison room,
where I could
conceal the
horrid anguish
that possessed
me. Despair!
Who dared talk
of that? The
poor victim,
who on the
morrow was to
pass the awful
boundary
between life
and death, felt
not, as I did,
such deep and
bitter agony. I
gnashed my
teeth and
ground them
together,
uttering a
groan that came
from my inmost
soul. Justine
started. When
she saw who it
was, she
approached me
and said, “Dear
sir, you are
very kind to
visit me; you,
I hope, do not
believe that I
am guilty?”

=====

Thus the poor
sufferer tried
to comfort
others and
herself. She
indeed gained
the resignation
she desired.
But I, the true
murderer, felt
the never-dying
worm alive in
my bosom, which
allowed of no
hope or
consolation.
Elizabeth also
wept and was
unhappy, but
hers also was
the misery of
innocence,
which, like a
cloud that
passes over the
fair moon, for
a while hides
but cannot
tarnish its
brightness.
Anguish and
despair had
penetrated into
the core of my
heart; I bore a
hell within me
which nothing
could
extinguish. We
stayed several
hours with
Justine, and it
was with great
difficulty that
Elizabeth could
tear herself
away. “I wish,”
cried she,
“that I were to
die with you; I
cannot live in
this world of
misery.”

=====

And on the
morrow Justine
died.
Elizabeth’s
heart-rending
eloquence
failed to move
the judges from
their settled
conviction in
the criminality
of the saintly
sufferer. My
passionate and
indignant
appeals were
lost upon them.
And when I
received their
cold answers
and heard the
harsh,
unfeeling
reasoning of
these men, my
purposed avowal
died away on my
lips. Thus I
might proclaim
myself a
madman, but not
revoke the
sentence passed
upon my
wretched
victim. She
perished on the
scaffold as a
murderess!

=====

From the
tortures of my
own heart, I
turned to
contemplate the
deep and
voiceless grief
of my
Elizabeth. This
also was my
doing! And my
father’s woe,
and the
desolation of
that late so
smiling home
all was the
work of my
thrice-accursed
hands! Ye weep,
unhappy ones,
but these are
not your last
tears! Again
shall you raise
the funeral
wail, and the
sound of your
lamentations
shall again and
again be heard!
Frankenstein,
your son, your
kinsman, your
early,
much-loved
friend; he who
would spend
each vital drop
of blood for
your sakes, who
has no thought
nor sense of
joy except as
it is mirrored
also in your
dear
countenances,
who would fill
the air with
blessings and
spend his life
in serving
you—he bids you
weep, to shed
countless
tears; happy
beyond his
hopes, if thus
inexorable fate
be satisfied,
and if the
destruction
pause before
the peace of
the grave have
succeeded to
your sad
torments!

=====

My father
observed with
pain the
alteration
perceptible in
my disposition
and habits and
endeavoured by
arguments
deduced from
the feelings of
his serene
conscience and
guiltless life
to inspire me
with fortitude
and awaken in
me the courage
to dispel the
dark cloud
which brooded
over me. “Do
you think,
Victor,” said
he, “that I do
not suffer
also? No one
could love a
child more than
I loved your
brother”—tears
came into his
eyes as he
spoke—“but is
it not a duty
to the
survivors that
we should
refrain from
augmenting
their
unhappiness by
an appearance
of immoderate
grief? It is
also a duty
owed to
yourself, for
excessive
sorrow prevents
improvement or
enjoyment, or
even the
discharge of
daily
usefulness,
without which
no man is fit
for society.”

=====

About this time
we retired to
our house at
Belrive. This
change was
particularly
agreeable to
me. The
shutting of the
gates regularly
at ten o’clock
and the
impossibility
of remaining on
the lake after
that hour had
rendered our
residence
within the
walls of Geneva
very irksome to
me. I was now
free. Often,
after the rest
of the family
had retired for
the night, I
took the boat
and passed many
hours upon the
water.
Sometimes, with
my sails set, I
was carried by
the wind; and
sometimes,
after rowing
into the middle
of the lake, I
left the boat
to pursue its
own course and
gave way to my
own miserable
reflections. I
was often
tempted, when
all was at
peace around
me, and I the
only unquiet
thing that
wandered
restless in a
scene so
beautiful and
heavenly—if I
except some
bat, or the
frogs, whose
harsh and
interrupted
croaking was
heard only when
I approached
the
shore—often, I
say, I was
tempted to
plunge into the
silent lake,
that the waters
might close
over me and my
calamities for
ever. But I was
restrained,
when I thought
of the heroic
and suffering
Elizabeth, whom
I tenderly
loved, and
whose existence
was bound up in
mine. I thought
also of my
father and
surviving
brother; should
I by my base
desertion leave
them exposed
and unprotected
to the malice
of the fiend
whom I had let
loose among
them?

=====

At these
moments I wept
bitterly and
wished that
peace would
revisit my mind
only that I
might afford
them
consolation and
happiness. But
that could not
be. Remorse
extinguished
every hope. I
had been the
author of
unalterable
evils, and I
lived in daily
fear lest the
monster whom I
had created
should
perpetrate some
new wickedness.
I had an
obscure feeling
that all was
not over and
that he would
still commit
some signal
crime, which by
its enormity
should almost
efface the
recollection of
the past. There
was always
scope for fear
so long as
anything I
loved remained
behind. My
abhorrence of
this fiend
cannot be
conceived. When
I thought of
him I gnashed
my teeth, my
eyes became
inflamed, and I
ardently wished
to extinguish
that life which
I had so
thoughtlessly
bestowed. When
I reflected on
his crimes and
malice, my
hatred and
revenge burst
all bounds of
moderation. I
would have made
a pilgrimage to
the highest
peak of the
Andes, could I,
when there,
have
precipitated
him to their
base. I wished
to see him
again, that I
might wreak the
utmost extent
of abhorrence
on his head and
avenge the
deaths of
William and
Justine.

=====

Our house was
the house of
mourning. My
father’s health
was deeply
shaken by the
horror of the
recent events.
Elizabeth was
sad and
desponding; she
no longer took
delight in her
ordinary
occupations;
all pleasure
seemed to her
sacrilege
toward the
dead; eternal
woe and tears
she then
thought was the
just tribute
she should pay
to innocence so
blasted and
destroyed. She
was no longer
that happy
creature who in
earlier youth
wandered with
me on the banks
of the lake and
talked with
ecstasy of our
future
prospects. The
first of those
sorrows which
are sent to
wean us from
the earth had
visited her,
and its dimming
influence
quenched her
dearest smiles.
